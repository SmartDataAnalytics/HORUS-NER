klass1,"The Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston, a combined statistical area, has had glimpses of the religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of religionists at the turn of the century. Early papers on the precursor Bábí religion by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright were noted, materials donated, and lost, and then other scholars began to write about the religion. The community began to coalesce being near to Green Acre, founded by Sarah Farmer, who publicly espoused the religion from 1901. From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Bahá'ís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913. Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area for about 40 days and across the United States for some 239 days. Most prominent were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt, who served in events in the Boston area, Green Acre boards, and national institutions of the religion. In addition to national leaders in the religion, a number of notable individuals joined the religion and were increasingly visible - such as Urbain Ledoux, James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., Nancy Bowditch, and Guy Murchie. The community moved from beginning to host public meetings to systematically support a presence in a Center in Boston with services and presentations on the religion. Starting about the 1950s and broadening into the 1960s there was wider recognition of the Bahá'ís themselves. Sometimes this took the form of noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran and other times noting local concerts and fairs with their participation. The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area. Over the last couple of decades it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children’s classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion."

After the gold rush the town was used for sheep and cattle grazing and for the production of potatoes and other crops.Following the First World War, the population diminished although the town managed to survive. The town hotel was burned down in 1938 and the Black Friday bush-fires of 1939 destroyed many of the buildings in the town. A road was built to Matlock by 1950 but it was not maintained properly and fell to ruin. The town was home to Kitty Cane, a former dancer and mining investor who owned a successful shanty on Walhalla-Wood's Point Road. When Cane died, her loyal customers and the local miners decided to carry her coffin to the Aberfeldy cemetery. Since Cane was an unusually large woman and because the miners were intoxicated, the coffin never made it to the cemetery and instead the miners buried her alongside the road. When travelling from The Thomson Dam to Aberfeldy, Kitty Cane's grave is about 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) after the Cast Iron Point lookout and on the left hand side of the road. Today there is only one permanent resident, historian Grahame Code (who has lived in the area for 50 years), and his family, although there is several holiday homes which are occupied on some weekends, land was released for public sale in 1999.

klass1,"Adelaide  (/ˈædəleɪd/ AD-ə-layd) is the capital city of the state of South Australia, and the fifth-largest city of Australia. It is situated on the land of the Kaurna people of the Adelaide Plains. In June 2014, Adelaide had an estimated resident population of 1.30 million. The demonym ""Adelaidean"" is used in reference to the city and its residents. Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges which surround the city. Adelaide stretches 20 km (12 mi) from the coast to the foothills, and 90 km (56 mi) from Gawler at its northern extent to Sellicks Beach in the south.Named in honour of Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, queen consort to King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for a freely-settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the River Torrens, in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people. Light's design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parklands. Early Adelaide was shaped by prosperity and wealth – up until the Second World War, it was Australia's third largest city. It has been noted for early examples of religious freedom, a commitment to political progressivism and civil liberties. It has been known as the ""City of Churches"" since the mid-19th century.As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevard of North Terrace, King William Street and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for its many festivals and sporting events, its food and wine, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. It ranks highly in terms of liveability, being listed in the Top 10 of The Economist Intelligence Unit's World's Most Liveable Cities index in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015. It was also ranked the most liveable city in Australia by the Property Council of Australia in 2011, 2012 and 2013."

klass1,"Adelaide Lead is a district in Victoria, Australia, site of a former settlement, located on Old Avoca Road, south-west of Maryborough, west of the Paddy Ranges State Park, in the Shire of Central Goldfields. Located on the northern slopes of the Central Highlands, 225 metres above sea level, the area is naturally characterised by Box-Ironbark forest. Remnants of aboriginal settlement include rock wells beside the Possum Gully Road.Adelaide Lead began as a mining settlement, and covered about 3 miles (4.8 km) along the banks of Timor Creek. A state school operated from 1863 to 1954. The building, which still stands, was later used as a community hall in which Saturday night 'old time' dances were held until the late 1970s.The area was in the eastern part of the Glenmona Pastoral Station, taken up by Isaac Moorson and Edmund McNeill in 1839 and officially established as Glenmona by Edmund McNeill and Charles Hall in 1845. In 1848 Glenmona controlled 62,080 acres (251.2 km2), grazing 12,000 sheep and 150 cattle. It was the second largest property in the area, centred on the Bet Bet Creek which provided permanent water. The property was owned by the Mills family from 1875 until 1995. When the property was sold in 1995 it comprised 1182 acres (478 hectares).Gold was officially first discovered at Adelaide Lead in December 1854.  Adelaide Lead is close to Daisy Hill where a shepherd on Glenmona station had discovered gold in 1848 and sold it in Melbourne. This discovery gained media attention, but pastoralists tried to keep any finds quiet for fear of the impact on their runs.  Gold was again discovered at Daisy Hill in June 1852 and brought many prospectors into the area.A major gold rush to Maryborough occurred from June 1854, although some miners had been working in the area from the previous December. The population grew from 150 to 1,300 in that month and from 7,000 to 20,000 in August 1854.Three men, one of whom was William Howard, were camped on their way to the rush at Daisy Hill and found gold at Opossum Gully. As Howard came from Adelaide, he named the location Adelaide Lead.The Adelaide Lead began as a rush of 60 diggers who pegged all of Opossum Gully. The lead was part of a long string of leads which stretched from north of Amherst  through Opossum Gully in the south and via the Inkerman Lead to Alma, seven miles (11 km) to the north. The lead followed Timor Creek on the east side. There were two hotels – the Adelaide Hotel and the Junction Hotel and a Camp was established in July 1855 under the control of Phillip Champion de Crespigny, the gold commissioner appointed to oversee the Amherst gold district.The Adelaide Lead goldfields were just a small part of a huge goldfield with very significant yields and large numbers of miners following the latest gold discoveries.Adelaide Lead was never formally gazetted as a township, it was only a postal district. At that time there were several other gazetted townships close by such as Amherst and Alma.The initial gold discoveries were alluvial and a series of new finds and rushes opened up over seven miles (11 km) of rich alluvial field from Daisy Hill to Alma. The depth of the main lead was 70 feet (21 m). New ground continued to be discovered throughout the 50s. In1858 it was reported that up to 8 ounces of gold was recovered from a load of wash dirt (60 buckets). In March 1858 the Maryborough and District Advertiser reported that 9 oz of gold was gained from a load of wash dirt at Adelaide Lead.  On 12 October 1858 a 22 oz nugget was reported as found at Adelaide Lead. A 25oz nugget was found at Adelaide Lead in June 1862. In October 1869 a 160oz nugget was found by Thomas Mole at a depth of 25feet.The population fluctuated enormously in the gold rushes and reached over 6000 at one stage. Sometimes the population of the area was mainly Chinese diggers. In October 1855 there were three encampments of Chinese at Adelaide Lead, which were visited by Bernhard Smith, Acting Gold Receiver at Amherst, who had been made Protector to watch over the interests of the Chinese.After the initial rush in 1855, numbers of miners at Adelaide Lead fluctuated and declined as the surface alluvial gold was exhausted. In 1860 the Croydon Reef was discovered and quartz mining commenced. The Croydon Reef mine yielded 26,000 oz of gold and the Federal Reef mine 5,000 oz. However there were very few large deep lead mines in the area, unlike Talbot, Alma and Timor.Prospectors remained in the district for many years, working the alluvial gullies and reefs. However discovery of gold in Western Australia later in the nineteenth century saw some of these miners move west.The lack of permanent water in the area was a problem for both miners and farmers who took up the small blocks of land. The Timor Creek only flowed after rain and residents depended on wells, tanks and small dams.Reports in a range of official documents record the following population numbers at Adelaide Lead: 1855 (June)- 6000, 1858 (Aug)- 2000, 1859 - 1055, 1861 - 405  1865 - 600  1923 - less than 100, 1974 - 50.The 1861 Census return for Adelaide Lead, Blutchers Reef and adjoining gold workings showed a total population of 405 (275 males and 130 females). Only 100 people were born in Victoria, with 169 born in England, 41 in Scotland and 24 in Ireland. 35 were born in Germany. This census listed no people from China. The census listed occupations: 207 men engaged in alluvial sinking, 30 in gold puddling, 45 as diggers undefined, 10 in quartz crushing amalgam and gold quartz raising, 5 in trading, 5 carters, 2 labourers, 3 food and drinks, 184 domestics or children (58 male, 126 female). There were 107 children from 0 to 9 years, with 110 men and 34 women aged 25 to 34 years."

The town's location now resembles an uneven paddock of some 10 acres (40,000 m2), but has little showing of its startling and significant historical prevalence. The town began as a mining settlement which was referred to as Daisy Hill, or sometimes Daisy Hill Creek, and extended throughout the village. After a discovery of gold during the Gold Rush of 1853, the location became known as an extremely rich goldfield soon thereafter. Prior to this discovery, Daisy Hill had gained a particular notoriety, due to an illegal gold rush in February 1849, that was based solely upon the spurious claims made by on Thomas ""Tommy"" Chapman, a shepherd and former Parkhurst prison delinquent. It has been said that Chapman sold a gold nugget substantial in size, and relative to that of an adult hand, to a Melbourne Jeweller, Mr. Bretani from Collins Street. Soon after this alleged sale, Chapman mysteriously vanished. Much confusion surrounds where Chapman actually found the nugget, or if in fact, he stole it, according to the March 1849 issue of the Maitland Chronicle newspaper. As for his disappearance, a number of shepherds used the alias of Thomas Chapman. The two principal colonial towns of Geelong and Melbourne were involved in the gold fever hype, since the California rush had also started, with the discovery of Daisy Hill, as was reported in local newspapers between February and March 1849. Because the actual location of Daisy Hill is still unknown, it often gets confused with a land division nearby in the Paddy Ranges known as the Daisy Hill Block, which was an earlier squatter survey lease in the Pyrenees. In addition to this, the Colonial Police Troopers were stationed at a place that had been widely known to be to referred to as Daisy Hill in 1849, which is located on the highway to Maryborough. However, newspapers of the period often loosely referred to Cluned Station, some 10 miles (16 km) east as the ""Pyrenees"". The village name actually comes from a mining camp which saw tens of thousands of miners rush the area, and changed the name from Daisy Hill to Amherst in 1855, after the area was surveyed. With a Post Office opening in January 1856,  (closed 1963), Amherst eventually became a municipality in 1858, which included the town of Talbot (formerly known as Back Creek, for rioting miners in 1855). Talbot increased in size and eventually replaced Amherst as the municipality. Much of the original township has been destroyed by bushfire, and little remains other than the Amherst Cemetery. Due to years of isolation, time stood still for Talbot as it exhibits the charm of restored buildings dating back to its thriving heyday."

Two years later they were explored in detail by the expedition of Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy.From 1909 until 1954 phosphate mining took place on Angaur, originally by the Germans, then the Japanese, and finally by Americans.

Xosa, the son of one of the leaders of the refugees, was made the first sultan. One of the earliest settlements in Mozambique and an important gold and ivory trading post, it posed a serious rival to the Portuguese settlement in Mozambigue until the mid-16th century, when Angoche was eclipsed by Quelimane as an entry port to the interior. However, Angoche continued to play a role in coastal trade and was an important economic and political centre in the region, with close ties to Ilha de Moçambique. In the 19th century, Angoche became the focus of the clandestine slave trade, which continued until the 1860s when the town was attacked by the Portuguese. While effective Portuguese administration was not established until several decades later, the attack marked the beginning of Angoche's downfall, and the town never regained its former status.Today, Angoche is a quiet, somewhat dilapidated district capital with few reminders of its past.  Several islands lie offshore from the town. The major language of Angoche and nearby Koti Island is Ekoti, a Makhuwa language borrowing from 15th century Swahili."

According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 5,698. The name of the town is derived from banket rock formation: early settlers saw a conglomerate, which they hoped would bear gold, like the banket of the Witwatersrand gold fields. The conglomerate was not gold-bearing, although gold was late discovered and, along with chromite, is still mined in the area. Cattle, maize, cotton and tobacco are commercially farmed in the area. Banket grew as a service centre for the surrounding mines and commercial farms, and has suffered from the downscaling of chromite mining in Zimbabwe. The town further suffered from the expropriation of white-owned commercial farms in the controversial land reform programme that began in 2000. The town's main source of income and business clientele, the farmers and businesspeople, all but disappeared from the scene, leading to a loss of business and income. The settlers who took over the farms failed to fill the gap created by the demise of commercial farms. This led to the collapse of retail businesses and the few industries that were in the town. The town has three primary schools (Kuwadzana, St Georges and Banket Primary) and two secondary schools (Kuwadzana High School and the Catholic-church-owned Sacred Heart Secondary School). It has a district hospital and a council clinic. The town grew primarily because of its role as a service centre for surrounding commercial farms and mining settlements.

klass1,"Barossa Reservoir is a reservoir in South Australia, built between 1899 and 1902 to supply water to Gawler and other northern country areas. Built at a cost of almost £170,000 the reservoir was hailed on completion as an engineering marvel, and at a total of 36 metres, was the highest in Australia. The thin arch of the dam retaining wall, curved against the pressure of the water, was an innovation considered radical, and attracted the Reservoir international attention. It was featured in the Scientific American and caused the American Engineers News to remark that its ""boldness of design deserves to rank with the most famous dams in the world"". Nowadays, the dam is notable for its parabola effect, where a voice can be heard clearly from one side to the other — over 140 metres, end to end. This unusual acoustic phenomenon is a popular tourist attraction, and has earned the dam the title ""Whispering Wall"" (see Whispering gallery).During construction large stones were used in the wall to save concrete and tram rails were used to reinforce the upper section. The Barossa Reservoir was formed by damming the Yettie Creek gorge in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, a feat that took over 400 men. Its water comes through a two-kilometre tunnel, carved by horse power,  from the South Para River and Reservoir, and is supplemented by the Warren Reservoir and the River Murray. In addition to Gawler and country, a filtration plant constructed in 1982 allows the Reservoir to supply the Munno Para and Elizabeth areas. The dam's vegetated surrounds are also protected.Aside from its Acoustic attraction, the Whispering Wall offers great views of both the Barossa Reservoir and the surrounding, well-preserved natural bounty. The area abounds in thick scrub, tall red gums, and pines, and a flourishing bird and animal life. It is a popular destination for picnics and bird-watching.Capacity: 4,515 megalitresLength of wall: 144 mHeight of wall: 36 mdepth at wall: 28.6 mType of wall: Concrete arch↑ 1.0 1.1 ↑ 2.0 2.1 ↑ ↑ ↑"

klass1,"Batu Kawan is an island and a town in the area of Penang, Malaysia. The island is situated off Seberang Perai, which is on the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by Sungai Jejawi and Sungai Tengah. Batu Kawan was long considered a quiet backwater, noted for sugar-cane, coconut and rubber plantations in the 19th century, before changing to oil palm plantations in the middle 20th century, which have now mainly fallen into disrepair. It was among the oldest towns in Penang, accessible only by ferry from Bukit Tambun. Development of the island has come under intense scrutiny after the government chose Batu Kawan as the mainland site for a major industrial area and the third satellite town of George Town, Penang after Bayan Lepas and Seberang Jaya. New industrial sites, commercial areas and residential schemes are expected to be developed in Batu Kawan town. Besides that, Batu Kawan is heading towards a bustling industrial hub just like the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Park and the Prai Industrial Area. Three big companies — Robert Bosch, Boon Siew Honda and VAT Manufacturing Malaysia — have pledged investments totalling about RM10bil to site their manufacturing plants in this town. Apart from that, the Penang state government announced an ambitious plan to build 11,800 medium-cost housing units under its RM2.7bil Bandar Cassia Affordable Housing Scheme, which would be modelled after Singapore’s Housing and Development Board (HDB) housing schemes. This area has also become a strategic location for the Penang Second Bridge which links Batu Kawan and Batu Maung on Penang Island. The bridge has sparked various economic activities including the mushrooming of new housing projects. Many people from Penang island are buying properties in Batu Kawan since the price is believed to be cheaper than that of the island. The island is also the location for the Batu Kawan Stadium, Penang's state stadium. When the land in Batu Kawan was acquired by the state investment arm, Penang Development Corporation (PDC) some 30 years ago, large tracts of land were cleared including for the construction of the state stadium. The stadium project and the setting up of an industrial estate were one of the early stages for the development of Batu Kawan. This tiny island also has many hidden historical gems, dating back to the days of the British colonial masters."
klass1,"Batu Maung is a small town in Penang, Malaysia. It is located in the southeastern part of Penang Island. It consists of several smaller villages namely Kampung Seronok (at the border with Bayan Lepas), Kampung Binjai, Permatang Damar Laut, Kampung Batu Maung, Kampung Teluk Tempoyak and Kampung Jalan Baru.Around 20 years ago, Batu Maung was only a small fishing village accessible only from Bayan Lepas. However, in the past few years, Batu Maung has experienced a rapid development due to its proximity to Bayan Lepas Free Trade Zone (FTZ). In 1994, a new 4-lane highway was opened that linked Batu Maung to Gelugor (known as coastal highway). This shortened the journey from Batu Maung to Penang Bridge to around 15 minutes from almost an hour previously.There are 3 primary schools and 1 secondary school in this area. The oldest school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Batu Maung was opened in 1884. The school has been renovated several times, however due to the limited land space available, the school lacks most of the common facilities such as proper playing field and hall.Due to land reclamation from the sea, the Bayan Lepas Free Trade Zone has now expanded to Batu Maung. Notable companies with factories in Batu Maung include Motorola and Nippon Express. This contribute to a population boom since people start to settle in Batu Maung due to its lower rental rate compared to established areas like Bayan Lepas and Bandar Bayan Baru.Batu Maung is home to the Fisheries Research Institute (FRI), a federal-government agency that focused on marine research. There is also a medium-size aquarium within its vicinity which is open to public at a minimal cost. In addition, WorldFish Center, a similar research institute owned by UNESCO also operated there after moving from The Philippines in early 2000. Its fishing port has also been designated as a deep-sea-fishing port by the Malaysian Government.Other notable attractions in Batu Maung include the War Museum (showcasing WW2 relics), seafood centre in Kampung Teluk Tempoyak, Tapak Gedembai (a giant footprint cast in stone) near the fishing port and Kampung Seronok (a cultural village, winners of the best village in Malaysia in the past).In August 2006, Malaysian Government has announced that the Penang's Second Bridge will be built from Batu Kawan (on the mainland) to Batu Maung (on the island)."

klass1,"This article is about the town. For other places in Poland with that name, see Białobrzegi (disambiguation).Białobrzegi [bʲawɔˈbʐɛɡʲi] is a town in Poland, in Masovian Voivodeship, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) south of Warsaw. Since 1998 it has been the capital of Białobrzegi County. From 1975 to 1998, the town administratively belonged to Radom Voivodeship. Prior to 1975, it belonged to Kielce Voivodeship (1919 - 1975). According to data from December 31, 2011, the city had 10,410 inhabitants. The city is located on the border of the Białobrzegi Valley and Radom Plain, about 30 miles (48 kilometres) northwest of Radom. The river Pilica flows through the town. Białobrzegi is placed on boundary of two major Polish historical regions - Lesser Poland and Mazovia, and was not administratively tied with Mazovia and Warsaw until 1999.The history of the town dates back to 1540, when King Sigismund I the Old granted town rights to the town of Brzegi, which was located on the left bank of the Pilica, on the territory of Lesser Poland. At that time, Brzegi belonged to a local noble woman Anna Fałęcka, then it was property of other families. The town never gained significance and remained a small center, whose population was involved in trade and agriculture. During the January Uprising, several units operated in the area, and in 1870, as a reprisal for residents’ support of the insurrection, Białobrzegi was stripped of its town privileges and became a settlement. In 1910, a fire destroyed much of Białobrzegi. During World War I, there was further destruction, but the town slowly grew, due to the Warsaw - Kraków road, which passed through it.In 1958 Białobrzegi, located then in Kielce Voivodeship, regained its town rights. It now is an important road hub, where Expressway S7 crosses with National Road nr. 48."

Forests are an important part of Białystok's character, and occupy around 1,756 ha (4,340 acres) (17.2% of the administrative area of the city) which places it as the fifth most forested city in Poland.The first settlers arrived in the 14th century. A town grew up and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally been one of the leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in Podlaskie and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. In the nineteenth century Białystok was an important center for light industry, which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. But after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down. Through the infusion of EU investment funds, the city continues to work to reshape itself into a modern metropolis. Białystok in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016. Over the centuries Białystok has produced a number of people who have provided unique contributions to the fields of science, language, politics, religion, sports, visual arts and performing arts. This environment was created in the mid-eighteenth century by the patronage of Jan Klemens Branicki for the arts and sciences. These include Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last émigré President of the Republic of Poland; L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto; and Albert Sabin, the co-developer of the polio vaccine."

It is part of the municipality of Glamorgan/Spring Bay. The town is primarily a fishing port and a beach resort.The town was named after James Ebenezer Bicheno, the British Colonial Secretary for Van Diemen's Land from 1843 to 1851.The first historical reference to the place that was to become Bicheno was made by Brian May during his circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land. He landed here (when it was known as Waubs Harbour) to dry his provisions. From 1803 Waubs Harbour was used as a whaling port. Bicheno was proclaimed a township in 1866. Bicheno Post Office opened as a receiving house on 1 January 1855.Near the tennis courts is the grave of Wauba Debar (after whom Waub's Harbour was named), an aboriginal who was stolen from her tribe as a teenager to become a ""sealer's woman"". Her bravery in rescuing two sealers in a storm is commemorated by a headstone.The hinterland was established for farming in the mid-1840s, which continues today. Coal was discovered in 1848. In 1854, the harbour was expanded to provide port facilities for the coal mines at Denison River. The coal was transported to the port via a 5‑km horse-drawn tramway.The use of Bicheno as a coal port was short-lived. The discovery of gold in Victoria saw most of the residents depart in 1855 and for nearly a century, Bicheno became a sleepy little fishing village. Fishing has continued to be the lifeblood of the town with substantial quantities of crayfish, abalone, scallops and trevally. In recent times it has become a popular tourist destination, with a range of accommodation, craft shops, two small aquaria, and a visitor centre. Visitors are also attracted to the little penguin colony on adjacent Diamond Island A nearby point of interest is the Bicheno Blowhole. A famous resident is the world champion swimmer Shane Gould.In September 2003 a memorial to the Merchant navy was unveiled in Bicheno. Five months later, in February 2004, the town presented a freedom of entry charter to the Australian Merchant Navy, the first time any locality in the world has granted 'freedom of the city' to the merchant Navy. Local primary school children have been appointed custodians of this memorial, built near Wauba Debar's grave."

Bigga is on the western side of the Abercrombie Mountains. It is 91 km northwest of Goulburn and 52 km southeast of Cowra. Nearby towns are: Abercrombie, Binda, Greenmantle, Grabine, Reids Flat, and Tuena. Nearby places are: Blanket Flat and Crooked Corner.

The first official land sale in the region was of 1,000 acres (400 ha) at Sandy Creek to Samuel Blackman in 1835. Sandy Creek was one of the first fine wool farms in the district. During the 1850s there was a land boom and numerous families added to the three original families of the area: the McGuinesses, Blackmans and the Hearnes. After this the area again did not attract new settlers until the 1880s. Bigga village was proclaimed in 1892. In May 1896 a Bigga and Blanket Flat progress association was formed."

klass1,"Bikini Atoll (pronounced /ˈbɪk.ɨˌniː/ or /bɨˈkiː.ni/; Marshallese: Pikinni, [pʲi͡ɯɡɯ͡inʲːii̯], meaning coconut place)  is an atoll in the Marshall Islands. The atoll consists of 23 islands totaling 3.4 square miles (8.8 km2) surrounding a deep 229.4-square-mile (594.1 km2) central lagoon at the northern end of the Ralik Chain (approximately 87 kilometres (54 mi) northwest of Ailinginae Atoll and 850 kilometres (530 mi) northwest of Majuro). Within Bikini Atoll, Bikini, Eneu, Nam and Enidrik islands comprise just over 70% of the land area. Bikini and Eneu are the only islands of the atoll that hosted a permanent population. Bikini Island is the northeastern most and largest islet. Before World War II, the atoll was known by its Baltic German name as Escholtz Atoll.Between 1946 and 1958, 23 nuclear devices were detonated by the United States at seven test sites located on the reef, inside the atoll, in the air, or underwater. They had a combined fission yield of 42.2 Mt. The testing began with the Operation Crossroads series in July 1946. Prior to nuclear testing, the residents initially accepted resettlement voluntarily to Rongerik Atoll, believing they would be able to return home within a short time. Rongerik Atoll could not produce enough food and the islanders starved for lack of food. When they could not return home, they were relocated to Kwajalein Atoll for six months before choosing to live on Kili Island, a small island one-sixth the size of their home island. Some were able to return to the Bikini Island in 1970 until further testing revealed dangerous levels of strontium-90. The islanders have been the beneficiary of several trust funds created by the United States government which as of 2013 covered medical treatment and other costs and paid about $550 annually to each individual.In 1996, the Bikini Council authorized diving operations as a means to generate income for Bikini islanders currently and upon their eventual return. The tours, limited to fewer than a dozen experienced divers a week, cost more than US$5000 and include detailed histories of the nuclear tests. The dive operations were managed from a shore-based facility until operations were suspended in 2008 when the Marshall Island airline ceased service due to unresolved mechanical issues. They have since been resumed from a live-aboard ship. While the island may be habitable in the near term, virtually all of the islanders alive today have never lived there. As of 2013, about 4880 Bikini people live on Kili and other Marshall Islands, and some have emigrated to the United States.  Bikini Island is currently visited by a few scientists and inhabited by 4-6 caretakers.The atoll and island gained world-wide attention due to nuclear testing, and because of the remaining direct tangible evidence of the nuclear tests, UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site.  Building on this attention, in 1946, French engineer Louis Réard named his new swimsuit design the bikini, in hopes that its revealing style would create an ""explosive commercial and cultural reaction"" similar to the 1946 nuclear explosion at Bikini Atoll."

It lies in northeastern corner of historic Lesser Poland, approximately 10 kilometres (6 mi) south of Ryki and 56 km (35 mi) north-west of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 610, and was officially a town from 1485 to 1869.The history of Bobrowniki dates back to the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, when this area was under authority of a castellan from Sieciechow. At that time, the nearby Wieprz river was abundant with Eurasian beavers. These animals were regarded as royal property because of their precious furs and were protected from hunting by royal officials, known as bobrownicy (hence the name of the village). The first documented mention of Bobrowniki comes from 1375, when it was located near the eastern border of Poland. The village was frequently destroyed in the raids of the Lithuanians, Yotvingians, Tatars and Rusyns. This ended in the late 14th century, when, after the Union of Krewo, the raids ended, and in the second half of the 15th century, Stanislaw Tarlo, the owner of Bobrowniki, managed to convince King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk to grant Magdeburg rights to the village. It happened on July 24, 1485. Bobrowniki remained a small town, whose population reached its maximum in c. 1660, when it was almost 2,000. After that, Bobrowniki declined, and its population was decimated by cholera (1780–85), when 1,600 died. After the Partitions of Poland Bobrowniki, which had for centuries belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship, was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 - 1915 it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland.  In 1840, Russian authorities built a fortress called Ivangorod, which later was renamed into Deblin.  Around the fortress a new town quickly emerged, together with an important railroad hub.  Bobrowniki declined even further, finally losing its town charter after the January Uprising.  The village now has a Baroque church, and two cemeteries - Roman Catholic and Jewish, as well as a monument dedicated to the Home Army."

The village has a population of 1,000, and is located on the right bank of the Vistula, on the road between Puławy and Kazimierz Dolny. The ruins of a 14th-century castle are located nearby.Bochotnica, which in the past was also called Bochotnica Mała (to distinguish it from nearby Bochotnica-Kolonia, or Bochotnica Wielka), is one of the oldest settlements in Lesser Poland. In the early years of the Kingdom of Poland, it was an important gord, located along merchant route from Kievan Rus towards central Poland. It now is a local tourist center, due to the picturesque Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula and proximity of Kazimierz Landscape Park. The village does not have a rail station, the nearest one is located at Puławy. It is a local road junction, where three roads meet.Even though no documents exist to prove it, Bochotnica already was a defensive settlement in the 6th century. This was confirmed by archaeologists, who in 1993 found here remains of the gord, together with a pagan cemetery and several artifacts, such as bronze and iron tools, gold coins and a 10th-century sword. Together with neighboring Wąwolnica, Bochotnica was a local administrative center. In 1317, King Władysław Łokietek handed Bochotnica and other local villages to brothers Ostaszko and Dzierżko from Bejsce (Lewart coat of arms). The defensive castle at Bochotnica was erected probably in 1340, after a devastating Tatar raid of Lublin Land. The stronghold was rectangular shaped, located on a hill, which provided it with a good view of the area. In the 15th century, the castle belonged to the Kurowski family, then it passed into the hands of Voivode of Lublin, Jan Oleśnicki, who changed his last name into Bochotnicki. On his initiative, the castle was remodeled in Renaissance style. Bochotnicki died childless, and after his death, in the late 16th century, the castle began to turn into a ruin. The village belonged to several families (Borkowski, Tarło, Lubomirski, Sanguszko, Potocki), and in 1826 it was owned by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, whose properties were confiscated by the Russians as a punishment for November Uprising. In 1886, new owner Józef Klemensowski, briefly considered reconstruction of the castle, but changed his plans.Until the Partitions of Poland, Bochotnica belonged to Lesser Poland’s Lublin Voivodeship. In 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and after World War I, it returned to Poland. On November 18, 1942, German occupiers murdered 45 people at local town square, as a reprisal for attack on a German patrol. After World War II, Bochotnica was a center of anticommunist resistance. On May 24, 1945, a battle between ex-Home Army unit and the NKVD took place, in which 16 Soviet agents and 10 Polish Communist collaborators were killed."

klass1,"Boguchwała [bɔɡuˈxfawa] is a town in Rzeszów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the administrative district of Gmina Boguchwała. It was officially granted town status on 1 January 2008. The name of the town means ""praise to God"".Boguchwała lies approximately 7 kilometres (4 mi) south-west of the regional capital Rzeszów. Its population is recorded as 5,712 (02.06.2009).In the Middle Ages, the area of contemporary Boguchwala was located in western outskirts of Red Ruthenia, near the border with Lesser Poland. It frequently changed hands, to be finally annexed into the Kingdom of Poland, by King Kazimierz Wielki (1340). Near Boguchwala, boundaries of three lands met: Sanok Land, Przemyśl Land, and Sandomierz Land, which was later changed into Sandomierz Voivodeship. Boguchwala itself was part of Sanok Land.In 1375, Roman Catholic Diocese of Przemyśl was established, covering the lands of Sanok and Przemyśl. Its creation spurred the influx of Polish settlers into the mostly abandoned Carpathian foothills. As a result, several parishes were established in local villages. In late 16th century, several villages near Boguchwala became property of Castellan of Sandomierz, Mikolaj Spytek Ligeza, who was the owner of Rzeszów. The time of relative growth and prosperity ended in 1624, when a Crimean Tatar raid resulted in burning of a number of villages, and deaths of thousands of residents.In the early 18th century, the Great Northern War brought widespread destruction to Boguchwala and its area. In 1702, Rzeszów and its vicinity was occupied by Swedish forces, which plundered the town. In 1704, Swedes were replaced by Saxon troops, which also robbed local residents. Further destruction was brought in 1715-16, during civil war known as Tarnogrod Confederation.In 1724, Duke Teodor Lubomirski named Boguchwala main center of his estate, creating the so-called “Boguchwala State”. Lubomirski wanted Boguchwala to compete with Rzeszow, and due to his efforts, the village received town charter in 1728, together with a new Rococo-style church. In 1772, after the first partition of Poland, the government of Austrian Galicia voided this decision and Boguchwala lost its town status. Before that happened, in early 1740s, Teodor Lubomirski expanded his manor house, turning it into a Baroque palace complex, with a spacious park.Boguchwala remained in the Habsburg Empire until late 1918. In 1895, the village received rail station, along the newly built line from Rzeszów to Jaslo. In the Second Polish Republic, Boguchwala was part of Lwow Voivodeship. In spring of 1939, construction of the ZAPEL plant ended, part of the Central Industrial Region.The Wehrmacht entered Boguchwala on September 6, 1939. The village was an important outpost of the Home Army, and local AK unit took part in the Operation Tempest.Boguchwala recovered its town charter on January 1, 2008."

It is a mountainous area thick with forest.Boridi is a remote village; not being along the Track, it misses out on the development that other track-side villages are experiencing with the increasing number of tourists. The nearest airstrip is in Milei, a 1-hour hike away for locals. There is no aid post (the nearest medical aid would be at Kagi or Efogi). There is a Seventh-day Adventist Church.The village is set up around a large quadrangle which serves as a community sports field (soccer and volleyball are very popular); houses line the edge of the field. There are usually several buildings to a household: a kitchen, a building for sleeping, and usually a pitpit/drop toilet. Buildings are made out of bush materials; modern materials have not made their way up here yet, partly because they are expensive and the villagers have limited access to cash; and partly because the mountainous terrain makes it extremely difficult to transport large items.The main cash crop is coffee. In previous years a coffee buyer from Port Moresby would charter a plane to Millea and locals would load it with bags of coffee beans, which would then be flown to Port Moresby to be sold. However, in 2006 there was no coffee buyer to fund the plane and so locals did not harvest the coffee. Recently rice has been introduced as another crop, but only a small amount is being grown at the moment. The community has a rice mill; what is harvested is used for food, or sold to people in nearby villages (there are no trade stores in the area; the nearest place to buy store goods is Port Moresby, two days and one night's hike away)."

klass1,"Borobudur, or Barabudur, is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist Temple in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. The monument consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. The temple is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa. It is the world’s largest Buddhist temple, as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.Built in the 9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty, the temple was designed in Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana. The temple also demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. The monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument and ascends to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: Kāmadhātu (the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades. Borobudur has the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world.Evidence suggests Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and abandoned following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam. Worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was advised of its location by native Indonesians. Borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations. The largest restoration project was undertaken between 1975 and 1982 by the Indonesian government and UNESCO, following which the monument was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Borobudur is still used for pilgrimage; once a year, Buddhists in Indonesia celebrate Vesak at the monument, and Borobudur is Indonesia's single most visited tourist attraction."

Bosten lake receives water inflow from a catchment area of 56,000 km2 (22,000 sq mi).The lake's Uyghur and Chinese names are sometimes rendered as Bosten Hu, Bagrax-hu, Bagrasch-köl, Baghrasch köl, Bagratsch-kul, Bositeng Lake or Bositeng Hu.The Kaidu River is the most important tributary to Lake Bosten, accounting for about 83% of its water inflow, other significant tributaries are the Huang Shui Ditch (Chinese: 黃水溝), the Qing Shui River (Chinese: 清水河), and  Wu-La-Si-Te River (Chinese: 烏拉司特河).An active fishery exists on the lake. Until the early 1970s, two cyprinid species, Schizothorax biddulphi and Aspiorhynchus laticeps, the latter of which is endemic to Bosten Lake and the Yarkand River, were responsible for 80 percent of the annual catch. During the years 1962 to 1965, other various carp species (bighead, black, silver, grass, common, and crucian carp) were introduced into the lake. In the 1970s, these species become major targets of the fishing activities. Since 1978, the European perch has been the dominating species in the catches from Bosten Lake."

Two runways of Sydney Airport extend into the bay. Botany Bay National Park is located on the northern and southern headlands of the bay.The land adjacent to Botany Bay was occupied for many thousands of years by the Tharawal and Eora Aboriginal peoples and their associated clans. On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of James Cook's first landing of HMS Endeavour on the continent of Australia, after his extensive navigation of New Zealand.

klass1,"Botshabelo, meaning ""a place of refuge"", is a large black settlement set up by the then apartheid government 45 km east of Bloemfontein, Free State province, South Africa. As many people moved away from the farms in the Free State, they looked for places to stay in the region of Thaba Nchu, another homeland under the old Bophutatswana government.The policy governing Bophutatswana at the time clearly stated that Bophutatswana belongs to those who are of Tswana tribe. As a result, all other tribes, mainly Southern Sotho and Xhosa, were put at a squatter camp named “Kromdraai”. Kromdraai was initiated by a man who was only referred to as ""Khoza"". He was selling a stand for only 50 cents around the year of 1976.Later on the government of Bophutatswana started to strongly condemn the development of that area and worked hard through their police force during the day and night, striving to dispatch everybody living in the region and who is not a Tswana. As the pressure mounted for the people of Kromdraai, Khoza fled and he was no longer to be seen anywhere.In 1979, the then Prime Minister of QwaQwa, Kenneth Mopeli together with the apartheid government found a place for all the people of Kromdraai at a farm called Onverwacht. All the people who were not Tswana started to move to Onverwacht for free, and later on when they started to settle in the area paid ZAR80 for a stand. Late in 1980 to early 1981 the name Onverwacht started to disappear and people started to call their place by the name of Botshabelo, this name given by Julius Nkoko.Botshabelo is one of the towns that have produced soccer players for the Premier Soccer League (PSL) especially for Celtics such as Madidilane, Ditheko Mototo, the late Abram Raselemane, Ntho Moshe, Motseothata November, Ace Gulwa,Lefu Nyapuli,Teboho Salemane and others.

klass1,"Botshabelo (""place of refuge"" in the Northern Sotho language) in the district of Middelburg, in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, originated as a mission station established by Alexander Merensky of the Berlin Missionary Society (BMS), in February 1865 in what was then the Transvaal Republic (ZAR). Merensky had fled with a small number of parishioners following the attacks on his previous mission station, Ga-Ratau, by the soldiers of Sekhukhune, the king of the baPedi. Within a year of having established the mission station, the population had grown to 420 persons.The BMS focused on providing schooling and bringing the gospel to people in their own language. Hence the Society’s missionaries were often at the forefront of publishing Bible translations, dictionaries and grammars in indigenous languages. It was as part of this process that Africans, duly trained and sometimes salaried, were accepted into the Society as teachers, catechists and lay-preachers, the so-called Nationalhelferen or national helpers.One of these was one Jan Sekoto who was sent for further training in Germany. Returning earlier than anticipated, however, he took up a teaching post at Botshabelo. Sekoto’s son Gerard Sekoto, born at Botshabelo in 1913, would later emigrate to Europe, obtaining French citizenship and achieving considerable renown as an artist.Besides the vestiges of the past, today Botshabelo is a living museum for the Ndebele architecture."

Brand camped at this spot at the Sakrivier, a dry river bed, which only occasionally had water after good rains – and which typically result in flash floods. The settlement was cut in two by such a flood in 1961. After it was recovered, a municipality was formed in 1962. This Brandvlei is located in the Bushmanland, also known as the Thirst Land, Dorsland in Afrikaans and should not be confused with the Brandvlei south of Worcester in the Western Cape.This area was once sub-tropical, such as during the Miocene period. Many fossils have that been found in the area back this fact for us. From 1910 the farmers used an irrigation method comparable to one used for thousands of years by the Egyptians. The surface is very flat, and water does not run away easily. This way the rainwater is spread over a larger area and are allowed to sink into the soil. The moisture in the area is enough to farm with crops on a very small scale. Farmers live on these crops once the rains have gone. On the long run this method is not feasible, as evaporating water leaves behind salt and other minerals. Today this method is no longer used.This region contains very little vegetation, primarily very low shrubs and yellow grass among a rocky desert kind of landscape. If you travel north from Brandvlei towards Kenhardt, you will pass through a huge landscape of nothingness for the next 200 km and more. During the seasons many birds flock to the pans, when they contain water, after some rainfall. Temperature above 40 °C is not uncommon."

It is 237 kilometres (147 mi) from Melbourne, Victoria's capital city.The Post Office opened on 23 November 1875. It was renamed Hallam in 1884 when an office named Buckrabanyule R.S (for Railway Station) was opened some distance away. This latter office became Buckrabanyule in 1902 and closed in 1992.Buckrabanyule is an Australian Aboriginal name meaning ""last of the hills"" or ""last of the ranges"" which is a rather appropriate description, since geographically, Mount Buckrabanyule (which lies just north of the township) is at the very end of the north-eastern extension of the Great Dividing Range. Standing atop Mount Buckrabanyule and looking north, the landscape is very flat all the way to the horizon. Until recently, thanks to the efforts of the Wychitella and District Landcare Group, the mountain was covered in a noxious weed, Wheel Cactus Opuntia robusta. Its population is only 14, and only qualifies as a ""township"" because several farmhouses are within a few kilometre's radius. Buckrabanyule is effectively a ghost town, as many residents left probably due to a shift from railway to road transport and its remote location. The remains of a Community Hall, Fire Station, Post Office and grain silos beside the railway line are all that is left. A church used to operate but was destroyed in a windstorm.On 2 August 2009, the community celebrated 100 years of the Buckrabanyule Hall, which was built in 1909 and officially opened on 31 July 1909. The hall is still regularly used by locals for meetings, community get-togethers and the annual Christmas Tree."

klass2,"Eskimo Recordings is a Ghent based record label that grew out of the eclectic parties that took place during the late nineties in the ‘Eskimo Fabriek’ in Ghent. These underground parties got famous for mixing synth-pop, new wave, acid house, funk and rock ‘n’ roll into a new and fresh sound, setting new standards for the Belgian club culture.International as well as local talented dj’s such as Mo & Benoelie (later to be The Glimmers), TLP and ‘The Flying Dewale Brothers’ (later to become 2 Many Dj’s) were usual guests at the turntables. As the ‘Eskimo fabriek’ needed refurbishment at the turn of the century, the Eskimo parties moved on to the Culture Club, and the temporary Belmondo concept at S.M.A.K museum.However, the vibe of these parties kept going trough a new label that was founded in 2000 by Stefaan Vandenberghe and Dirk De Ruyck : ‘Eskimo Recordings’. From the very start, timeless quality and originality were the key values upon which the label was based. Old and new music were caferully combined into a fancy fresh sound.The first compilation release reflecting this Eskimo ethos came out in June 2000 : “Eskimo: Various Artists And Many Others”. This first volume was compiled by Dirk, Mo & Benoelie and featured 70’s disco and funk as well as pop-soul, obscure acid hip house and new soul gem Revival by Martine Girault. The subsequent volumes 2-4 evolved into a kind of Balearic attitude, akin to DJ Alfredo’s approach in Ibiza’s Amnesia in the late 80s.In 2002, a darker sounding strain of compilations called “Serie Noire” was released. These compilations relate more to a sound Gent was familiar with before the Eskimo existed: the new beat.Soon after that, Mo & Benoelie acquired an international dj status under the name of “The Glimmers”, allowing them to spread the Eskimo ethos across the globe.This allowed the Eskimo story to evolve : The compilations were still defined generically but came with a DJ attached now. Various Dj’s made several compilations, respecting the ‘Eskimo approach’ The Glimmers had started : dig deep in the crates to form a unique listening experience.Throughout the years, Eskimo grew into an independent label that presented new talent such as Lindstrom &  Prins Thomas who released their successful debut album in 2005 with Eskimo Recordings. This led to several releases with the like-minded Aeroplane who immediately caused a splash across Europe and particularly in the U.K becoming the label’s most recognised act.Time flew by quickly, and in 2012 Eskimo Recordings got to celebrate a decade of existence and did it with a fancy packed compilation release called : “Eskimonde : a decade of Eskimo Recordings”. This 5-CD release explores the label's catalog from a few different angles. Two ""retrospective"" discs come along with newly commissioned remixes as well as two final discs that show The Glimmers splitting up for solo mixes, both coursing through Eskimo's back catalog.A year later in 2013, Eskimo Recordings gracefully entered its second decade of collection releases with a new concept : “The color collections”. These collections contain each a set of carefully selected songs that were all produced exclusively for this concept.So far the Pink, Blue and Green collection have been released already, and a new colour collection is to be expected soon."

The company's headquarters was in Glen Rock, New Jersey, but later moved to another New Jersey borough, Upper Saddle River. While the company was based in New Jersey, David Crane worked out of his home on the West Coast. The company's name was chosen because it was alphabetically above Activision, implying that Absolute Entertainment was superior to Activision .

However, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) had already displaced Atari's dominance of the video game console market.

klass2,"The Alden Shoe Company is a shoe company founded in 1884 by Charles H. Alden in Middleborough, Massachusetts. Aldens specializes in handcrafted men's leather boots and dress shoes, such as Oxfords, Blüchers, loafers, and Chukka boots.In the 19th century, there were once hundreds of shoemakers in New England, but now Alden is one of only two factories, the other being Rancourt & Co of Maine. Alden is considered a heritage, family-owned brand. Many of the company's roughly 100 workers at its factory in Middleborough are second or third generation, and it sources its leathers mostly from small tanneries in Europe and the U.S. – its shell cordovan comes from the last such tannery in America, Horween Leather Company. Alden has used Horween as their leather supplier since 1930, and is their largest cordovan customer.Along with other brands of Americana, Alden has experienced something of a resurgence in 21st century men's fashion. Despite a recession in the late-2000s and the relatively high prices of their products, Alden has grown again because of a renewed interest in more traditional men's shoes and boots, which can last decades. It is this reliance on high-end shoes, especially by those interested in business attire, that has allowed the company to avoid going under despite the decline of American shoe manufacturing.In popular culture, Alden model 405 boots (commonly referred to as the Alden ""Indy"" boot) were the shoe of choice for Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones character in the film versions of the franchise."

In the 1970s, when IBM had come to dominate the mainframe industry, Amdahl created plug-compatible machines that could be used with the same hardware and software as offerings from IBM, but were more cost-effective. Boasting faster uniprocessors, the largest single image, greater performance characteristics and higher reliability, the Amdahl mainframe was compelling to buyers who were willing to consider alternatives to IBM. These machines gave ""Big Blue"" some of the little competition it had in that very high-margin computer market segment.

klass2,"Brain was a Hamburg-based record label prominent in the 1970s releasing several important Krautrock records by bands such as Neu!, Cluster and Guru Guru. Many of its more prominent records are currently being reissued on CD by Repertoire Records.In the middle of 1971, Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser's management style at Ohr caused two of his A&R men, Bruno Wendel and Günter Körber, to leave Ohr and set up their own record company, which they called Brain. Wendel & Korber brought Guru Guru with them from Ohr, and immediately signed Cluster, who had recorded one LP for Philips; they soon recorded and released Cluster II.Brain was rapidly a success throughout West Germany and much of western Europe, although had little presence in the US. Signings throughout the seventies and into the eighties included Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia, Klaus Schulze, Edgar Froese, Guru Guru, Grobschnitt, Novalis, Jane, Birth Control, Embryo, Popol Vuh, Curly Curve, Scorpions, Electric Sun, Accept and many more.A later reissue series called Rock On Brain saw many early Brain recordings reissued, although mostly with entirely different sleeves and even album titles. Brain also reissued a number of recordings licensed to their parent company Metronome, such as Amon Düül's first album Psychedelic Underground. Many came out on the M2001 label which is closely linked to Brain.It is also interesting to note that Brain licensed and issued a number of British releases for the West German market, in this case mainly featuring the original sleeves. These included Greenslade, Caravan, If, Spirogyra, Atomic Rooster, Alexis Korner, Gryphon and Steamhammer. There were of course exceptions - the Brain issue of Atomic Rooster's Nice n Greasy features an entirely different sleeve to the UK issue, and If's Double Diamond didn't receive a UK release at all.Some Brain releases later proved highly influential. Brain 1004 was Neu!'s eponymous debut Neu!; Brain 1062 was Neu! 75, which undoubtedly contributed to the sound of punk rock.Körber left in 1976 to start Sky Records, which released lots of Cluster-related music plus Michael Rother's early solo work, and bands like Streetmark. When he left the labels of Brain LPs changed from green to orange."

klass2,"CNR is a Dutch record and video/DVD label. It was founded as CNR Records by Cornelis Nicolaas Rood in 1937, who made his fortune as a producer of lampshades and other lighting materials.Initially, Mr Rood regarded his record label merely as a hobby, but things changed for the better in the early 1950s when CNR bought distribution and marketing rights for several foreign pop and classical record companies. He also signed up several local artists.One of CNR's first major successes was Dutch singer Gert Timmerman, who became one of the Dutch top selling male artists from the end of the 1950s. In the 1960s, CNR enjoyed major successes with artists like Trio Hellenique, Gert Timmerman (who was also part of a duo, Gert & Hermien) and Heintje, a Dutch teenage singer who sold millions of singles and albums in Europe between 1966 and the early 1970s.By this time, CNR had grown into one of the Dutch major independent record labels. It mainly focussed on local talent such as André van Duin, Benny Neyman and Tol Hansse, but it also had hit singles with licensed international productions like Baccara's Yes Sir, I Can Boogie and Sorry, I'm A Lady.Local success continued well into the 1980s with artists including Stars on 45. CNR began distributing the up-and-coming Jive Records label in 1982. In the budding video market, CNR had a major presence with its CNR Video label, which specialised in kids material (Bassie & Adriaan).In the early 1990s, CNR had become a subsidiary of Arcade Records, which was then a major compilation label in the Netherlands. However, Arcade was on the brink of bankruptcy and warned that all its signed artists could lose their recording contracts if the bankruptcy went ahead. In the end, Arcade survived, but CNR's output and success diminished drastically later in the decade.It also underwent several management, licensing and name changes, including a joint venture with American rock label Roadrunner Music in 1998.Today, CNR is independent once again, currently billed as CNR Entertainment, with the emphasis on local product, kids material, comedy and TV series.

At the top of the Brazilian football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B.Organized by the Brazilian Football Confederation, the seasons are usually run from May to December, with teams playing 38 matches each (playing each team in the league twice, home and away) totalling 380 matches in the season. The league rounds are usually played in Sunday afternoons and Wednesday evenings. It is currently sponsored by Chevrolet and thus officially known as the Brasileirão Chevrolet.Due to historical peculiarities and the large geographical size of the country, Brazil has a relatively short history of nationwide football competitions. Only in 1959, with the advancements in civil aviation and air transport and the need to appoint a Brazilian representative to the first edition of the Copa Libertadores in 1960, was a nationwide tournament created, Taça Brasil. Before the establishment of a national league, the most prestigious football competitions in Brazil were the state leagues, notably the Campeonato Paulista and Campeonato Carioca, the premier leagues of the States of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro respectively, and a tournament between both states, the Torneio Rio-São Paulo. In 1967, the Rio-São Paulo was expanded to include teams from other states, becoming the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, which was also considered a national tournament. The first Campeonato Brasileiro with that name was held in 1971. The three tournaments -  Taça Brasil, Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, and Brasileirão - were unified by CBF in the Brazilian championship history in 2010.Since its inception, the Campeonato Brasileiro has grown in stature, being considered one of the strongest leagues in the world. The Campeonato Brasileiro contains the most club world champions titles, with 10 championships won among 6 clubs. The league is the second in containing the most clubs to have won the Copa Libertadores with 17 titles won among 10 clubs, only behind the Primera División Argentina, with 24 titles. The league is also one of the world's most powerful, ranked as the 6th most valuable with a worth of over $1.43 billion. It is also one of the world's richest championships, generating an annual turnover of over $1.169 billion in 2012.

Santos and Palmeiras are the most successful clubs of the Campeonato Brasileiro, having won the competition 8 times each. Santos' Os Santásticos, considered by some the best club team of all times, won 5 consecutive titles between 1961 and 1965, a feat that remains unequaled until today. The State of São Paulo is the most successful state, amassing 28 titles among 5 clubs.

klass2,"The Campeonato Brasileiro Série C is the third tier of the Brazilian football league system.Unlike the first and second divisions, the Série C is not played in a double round robin system, arguably because many participating teams lack the financial conditions to travel long distances. Thus, the tournament is organized in regional groups and the table prevents teams from distant states to play each other in the initial rounds.Until 2008, any professional team could apply, but only 64 teams would take part in the tournament. The teams that had been relegated from Série B in the previous year were joined by teams qualified for each federation state. Qualification rules varied, some federations used the state tournaments as qualification tournaments, others organized exclusive qualification tournaments to the Série C.Beginning in 2009, Série C was reduced from 64 teams to 20 and a new Campeonato Brasileiro Série D is the qualifier for Brazilian league football. In its current format the 20 teams are dived into 2 groups and each team plays all opponents from its own group on home and away matches. The top four teams of each group qualify to a knock out stage and the four semifinalists are promoted to Campeonato Brasileiro Série B. The bottom two teams of each group are relegated to Campeonato Brasileiro Série D."

However, although ACCA is UK based, it is a global body for professional accountants with 170,000 qualified members and 436,000 students globally.  Support offices/centres exist in 91 countries.The term Chartered Certified Accountant was introduced in 1996.  Prior to that date, ACCA members were known as Certified Accountant.

Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.Since Chartered Certified Accountant is a legally protected term, individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA.

klass2,"About ESS TechnologyFor more than three decades ESS Technology has been in the audio technology space. A privately held, fabless semiconductor company, ESS Technology designs and markets high-performance analog and HiFI audio devices for mobile, consumer, automotive, and professional audiophile systems. The company was founded in 1984 by Forest Mozer to produce synthetic speech for various devices including the first wave of speech enabled toys and iconic home computer systems, like the Commodore 64 . Today ESS Technology is best known for its SABRE series of high-performance audio products.HistoryFred Chan joined Forest Mozer in 1984 and in early 1985 assumed leadership of the company and was appointed chairman of the board. Chan was the founder and former president and CEO of AC Design Inc., a VLSI chip design center, and cofounder, president, and CEO of CADCAM Technology Inc. By the end of the 1980s, the company had taken on the leadership position in speech synthesis and Chan saw the tremendous opportunity for growth in the burgeoning PC space. In the early 1990s ESS experienced success in the PC market when it introduced the first single-chip audio device under its AudioDrive product line.  AudioDrive integrated all the elements for sound on the PC and eliminated the need for separate devices, such as add-in sound cards.ESS Technology went public in October 1995 and began 1996 as a leader in audio solutions for the PC marketplace, with 35 percent market share.   By the end of 1996, the company had shipped more than 90 million sound chips for PCs. The Move into Consumer ElectronicsIn the mid-1990s, ESS further expanded its audio footprint and also began to move into the graphics space.  The AudioDrive product line began offering products that included high-fidelity performance and 3D audio effects, an audio accelerator and an AC’97-compatible codec solution. On the video front, the company released a single-chip MPEG-2A/V and transport decoder for set-top box, Video CD (VCD) and DVD applications. Entrance into the video market was accelerated by the acquisition of VideoCore Technology Inc.; a company that had mastered advanced digital video compression. The new ESS product line, called VideoDrive, was built around a proprietary core engine, and a programmable multimedia processor, which consisted of a DSP architecture integrated with a RISC processor. Videocore offered the high performance needed to decompress and display video images.By now, the company had the necessary technology portfolio to gain entry into the high-volume consumer electronics space. By integrating both the front-end and back-end functions onto a single chip, ESS lowered overall system cost for DVD and VCD systems – without compromising video or audio performance. Core competencies in both video and audio enabled ESS to gain the number one position as a provider of SoCs to the video compact disc market, which would quickly become the DVD market.The Start of the AUDIO RevolutionIn the 2000s ESS, felt the effects of the recession and the increased pressures of commoditization, competition and a shifting ecosystem resulting from the emergence of streaming content services. These market forces caused the company to retrench and divest its DVD lines. Focus was placed on improving the audio technology portfolio. A key acquisition was made in 2001 when ESS acquired a small Canadian company, SAS, for R&D operations in Kelowna, BC.  The new ESS, enhanced by the synergy of the acquisition, made a vital breakthrough – they created a new 24/32-Bit 8 Channel SABRE DAC that is highly regarded by true audiophiles as the best in the Industry. In 2007 CEO Robert Blair felt that analog technical leadership was the key to the company’s long-term success.  After returning to profitability that year a deal was negotiated for Imperium Partners Group LLC to acquire ESS Technology and take the company private. By the end of 2008, the renewed focus on analog and audio enabled the company to introduce two of its most successful product lines:SABRE  (2008) – DAC and ADC products that initially captured the professional audiophile market, and have now moved into smartphones, automobiles and recording studios.Crescendo (2010) – Sound bar products leveraged the company’s experience with DVD OEMs who were offering mass-market, home-theatre consumer products. In 2013 the company launched its first SABRE DAC targeted specifically at the mobile market – with the necessary low-power and audio requirments for audiophile grade devices.ESS Technology TodayIn 2015 ESS is expanding its footprint in the mobile space with more design wins with companies like Vivo and Xiaomi. The company still focuses on high-end audiophile customers while working to penetrate new adjacent markets like automotive and mainstream consumer electronics."

klass2,"Electra was a brand of electric guitars and basses manufactured in Japan and distributed in the US by two companies owned by brothers: Saint Louis Music (SLM) and Pacific Coast Music in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2013, the brand launched a successful comeback led by renowned luthiers Ben Chafin and Mick Donner.Unlike most other brands of imported guitars which were sourced from a single manufacturer, Electra guitars were ordered from all the Japanese factories and distributors. As a result, early models especially vary in details and quality. Later, as all models came to be made by Matsumoku, Electra guitars offered high quality at competitive prices. However, the brand never entirely lost its association with inexpensive 'copy' guitars and the brand name was transitioned to Electra Westone in 1984 and Westone in 1985. The same qualities make them popular among collectors today.In 2013 Ben Chafin, former head luthier at Dean Guitars, acquired the rights to Electra Guitars and is now producing new Electra Guitars. The first model available was a reissued and updated single cutaway Electra Omega, followed by the Omega Prime. After rave reviews and a growing roster of artist endorsements, Electra Guitars unveiled a number of new models in 2014 including the Invicta, Talon, Phoenix H & S Guitars and the Phoenix Bass. More about the current company and their guitars, basses, accessories and merchandise can be found at their official website Electra Guitars"

The 28 private electricity companies of the time were nationalized and absorbed into the EAC. The Authority never received any subsidies from the government as these have always been prohibited by law. Its head office is located in Strovolos. The EAC currently holds a near monopoly on electricity generation in Cyprus. It operates through three power stations with a total capacity of 1460MW: Dhekelia Power Station - 460MW Moni Power Station - 140MW + 125MW in storage and set for disassembly Vasilikos Power Station - 860MWThe company also distributes electricity produced by five privately held windfarms: Orites - 82MW Santa Anna - 20MW Alexigros - 31.5MW Koshi - 10.8MW Aeolian - 10.8MWAdditionally, individuals and private companies own more than 40MW of solar panels and almost 10MW of biofuel installations and the EAC distributes the electricity these produce too.In 2013, the EAC generated a total of 3,942GWh of electricity consuming 883,071 tonnes of fuel costing €485,492,000. Maximum demand in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus reached 815MW, rising to 871MW in 2014 (almost 7% increase). A total of 6.5GWh of the produced electricity in 2013 valued €1,285,000 ended up in the area occupied by Turkey and no money could be collected for it.The Authority served 549,448 customers in 2013, that is 254 per employee, up from 242 in 2012. The electricity sales per employee reached 1.80GWh, down from 1.92GWh in 2012.Company investments in 2013 on its assets reached €56,795,000.On 11 July 2011, a total of 98 containers of munitions stored at Evangelos Florakis Naval Base adjacent to Vasilikos Power Station exploded causing extensive damage to the station. To cope with the extended loss of its largest power station, the Authority had to impose rolling blackouts. In 2010, the maximum demand had reached 1,144MW, the highest ever, and an even higher one was expected in 2011.As a precondition to the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, the local market for electricity generation has been opened to private companies, but so far no private power plants have been built, although four licenses have been granted by Cyprus Energy Regulation Authority. In the meanwhile, the EAC diversified into communication and cable television services in cooperation with a private company.In 2005, the company was involved in a high profile scandal involving the alleged theft of millions of Cyprus pounds from the employees' pension scheme."

klass2,"Gnome Press was an American small-press publishing company primarily known for publishing many science fiction classics.The company was founded in 1948 by Martin Greenberg and David A. Kyle. Many of Gnome's titles were reprinted in England by Boardman Books. Martin Greenberg of Gnome Press was a New York science fiction fan and member of the Hydra Club, not to be confused with the later Martin H. Greenberg the SF anthologist. David A. Kyle was another New York based science fiction fan, a Futurian as well as a member of the Hydra Club.  The address was Gnome Press, Inc., 80 E. 11th St. New York 3, N.Y.Gnome was the first to publish Isaac Asimov's I, Robot and Foundation Trilogy, brought Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories back from pulp obscurity, first published Arthur C Clarke, and introduced science fictions first themed anthology Men Against the Stars.Controversy surrounds the Gnome Press editions of Robert E. Howard's ""Conan"" stories. The Gnome Press editions placed the material in print for the first time since its original appearance in Weird Tales, but also included one volume not written by Howard (The Return of Conan) and one volume of non-Conan Howard stories extensively rewritten as Conan by SF writer L. Sprague de Camp (Tales of Conan).It also published many of Robert A. Heinlein's classics, and Children of the Atom by Wilmar Shiras. Andre Norton worked as a reader for Gnome Press in the 1950s, and also had two of her novels published by the company under the pseudonym ""Andrew North"" (Plague Ship and Sargasso of Space).Gnome featured the work of many noted science fiction artists as well as authors. Those who contributed illustrative material for Gnome editions, including cover art, illustrations, maps and designs, included Ric Binkley, Hannes Bok, Chesley Bonestell, Edd Cartier, Lionel Dillon, Frances E. Dunn, Ed Emshwiller, Frank Kelly Freas, James Gibson, Harry Harrison, Mel Hunter, David Kyle, Stan Mack, Murray Tinkelman, L. Robert Tschirky, Walter I. Van der Poel, Jr., and Wallace Wood.Gnome Press did not have much capital or access to distribution facilities.  The company was notorious for not paying their writers royalties due, which is ultimately what lead to its failure. Asimov claimed he was never paid for the publication of the Foundation books, and called Greenberg ""an outright crook"".Asimov and other authors were able eventually to repossess the rights to their publications, and the company failed during 1962. Martin Greenberg was forced to close due to financial troubles. According to Filmfax, Greenberg couldn't keep top science fiction and fantasy writers, who wanted more money and went over to bigger publishers like Doubleday. Despite these problems, Gnome was one of the most eminent of the fan publishers of sf, producing 86 titles in its lifespan - many considered classic works of SF and Fantasy today. Gnome published many of the major sf authors, and in some cases, as with Robert E Howard's Conan series (published in 6 books 1950-1955) and Isaac Asimov's Foundation series (published in 3 books 1951-1953), was responsible for the manner in which their stories were collected into book form. Other notable authors included Arthur C Clarke, Robert A Heinlein, Poul Anderson, Gordon Dickson, Clifford D. Simak, L. Sprague deCamp, A. E. Van Vogt, and C L Moore. Despite a common assumption among some fans, there was no association with the imprint Greenberg: Publisher, a separate company established in 1924 and producing some science fiction between 1950 and 1958. In the waning years of the company (1955-1961), Gnome Press bought small quantities of unbound signatures from the defunct specialty publisher Fantasy Press and had them cheaply bound to be sold through Gnome's Pick-A-Book operation (a revised, later incarnation of their Fantasy Book Club), an early form of direct-mail sales that formed the basic idea for Doubleday's more successful Science Fiction Book Club. Most of the Gnome Press books were hardcover, but some few titles saw later paperback editions as Greenberg experimented, using his remaining stock of unbound sheets, with several titles bound in inexpensive paper covers as a test to see if such an effort could help to keep the company afloat. But with his Pick-A-Book hardcover titles already going for as little as $1.00 per book, the experiment did not save enough money to be profitable and was dropped (and these few paperbound titles are among the scarcest of Gnome Press collectibles today). Gnome Press was important in the transitional period between Genre SF as a magazine phenomenon and its arrival in mass-market book Publishing, but proved too underfunded to make the leap from fan-based publishing to the professional level.Gnome Press publications are collected, and many of the books in well used condition can be inexpensively obtained (as of 2015 Amazon was offering several in the $10–$20 range).  Other items are expensive.  The calendars are particularly scarce.  Among the books I, Robot, either in hardcover form or the Armed Forces paperback edition set from its plates, is in particular demand.The first Robert E. Howard novel, “Conan the Conqueror” appeared in 1950 and was followed by several others, including “The Sword of Conan” (1952), “The Coming of Conan” (1953), “King Conan” (1953), “Conan the Barbarian” (1954), “Tales of Conan” (1955), and “The Return of Conan” (1957).As Gnome Press started to publish new books, Greenberg and Kyle set up the Fantasy Book Club, a subscription service designed to sell Gnome publications and books from other publishers at a discount. They also produced calendars featuring the black and white fantasy art of Hannes Bok & Edd Cartier. Below are examples of Edd Cartier’s art featuring gnomes and other fantasy characters. Gnome Press existed for just over a decade until they ultimately failed because of their inability to compete with major publishers who also started to publish science fiction. The larger publishers had more money, marketing and distribution outlets (the ability to sell wholesale to bookstores) while Gnome press relied on selling their books directly to fans by mail.“But if you look at one of Gnome Press’s old catalogs, you find you are staring at a million dollars. The authors they had! Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein. Arthur C. Clarke. They had them all. They had the rights to books that have collectively sold tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of copies since, and they had acquired them at prices that would make a cat weep.” – Frederik PohlFinancial mismanagement also cut into there ability to keep authors who jumped ship to the larger publishers. Author Isaac Asimov reported Gnome Press never paid him for his “Foundation” novels, but Asimov and other authors managed to get back the rights to their books to they could go to other more lucrative deals. In his biography, “I, Asimov: A Memoir,” by Isaac Asimov, the author provides a short chapter on his own frustrating interactions with Gnome Press, as well as some good detail on its publisher, Martin Greenberg.Had Gnome Press succeeded as a publisher and kept their stable of authors they would have been a powerhouse in the science fiction genre. When Gnome Press went out of business, it was $100,000 in debt. Martin Greenberg died in the fall of 2013. David Kyle is still with us, and still an ardent SF fan."

The Ulster Railway was the GNRI's oldest constituent, having opened between Belfast and Lisburn in 1839 and extended in stages to reach Clones in 1863. The Northern Railway of Ireland was itself formed by a merger of the Dublin and Drogheda Railway (D&D) with the Dublin and the Belfast Junction Railway (D&BJct).The Ulster, D&D and D&BJct railways together formed the main line between Dublin and Belfast, with the D&BJct completing the final section in 1852 to join the Ulster at Portadown. The GNRI's other main lines were between Derry and Dundalk and between Omagh and Portadown. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway together with the Londonderry and Enniskillen Railway enabled GNRI trains between Derry and Belfast to compete with the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, and both this and the Dundalk route gave connections between Derry and Dublin. These main lines supported the development of an extensive branch network serving the southwest half of Ulster and northern counties of Leinster. The GNRI became Ireland's most prosperous railway company and second largest railway network.  In its early years the GNR(I) closely imitated the image of its English namesake, adopting an apple green livery for its steam locomotives and a varnished teak finish for its passenger coaches. Later the company adopted its famous pale blue livery for locomotives (from 1932), with the frames and running gear picked out in scarlet.

Based in Montreal, the company oversees generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for all of Quebec.Relying almost exclusively on its sixty hydroelectric generating stations, Hydro-Québec is the largest electricity generator in Canada and the world's largest hydroelectric producer. As of 2011, the combined capacity of its power stations was 35,829 megawatt (MW) and its distribution network served 4.11 million customers.The development of several large-scale hydroelectric projects which took place non-stop from the late 1940s to the mid-1990s — the Bersimis, Carillon, Manic-Outardes, Churchill Falls and the two phases of the James Bay Project — allowed Quebec to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. In 2009, primary electricity accounted for 40.05% of all energy used in the province. However, the construction and operation of these projects has led to conflicts with aboriginal populations living in Quebec's North.Hydro-Québec has played a ""nearly mythical role"" in Quebec's economic development since its establishment, with its sustained capital investments, by fostering local engineering expertise and by its capacity to generate large quantities of renewable electricity at low prices.The increasing demand for competitively priced renewable electricity fostered by the fight against climate change had a positive impact on Hydro-Québec's balance sheet in the last decade. Between 2008 and 2012, the company paid C$8.9 billion in dividends to its sole shareholder, the Government of Québec,  while keeping Quebec retail power rates among the lowest in North America."

klass2,"WPAA is a radio station, broadcasting from the campus of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.Founded using Phillips alum and then-NBC president Robert Sarnoff's gift of $15,000, the station was launched in 1965 by a host of famous personalities, including Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, David Brinkley, Sammy Davis Jr., and Hugh Downs. The station's signal was powered by a 33 watt transmitter and reached over 104 square kilometers, which, at launch, had the potential to reach over 150,000 people. Until 2003, the station broadcast on the frequency 91.7FM from Phillips Academy's Evans Hall. The station was then transitioned to an internet webcast, which is currently available online at www.WPAA.comSince the demolition of Evans Hall in 2004, WPAA has broadcast from the basement of Morse Hall. The online station, which operates as a student-run organization, continues to stream both talk and music shows on week nights and weekends. The group also offers recording opportunities for student performers and provides live sound equipment for nearly all campus events, including the station's ""Battle of the Bands"" every spring. In 2004 The Federal Communications Commission visited and inspected the class-D FM radio station WPAA and determined that WPAA was off the air for more than one year, in violation of federal regulations, so the FCC deleted and revoked the license for WPAA.  Ironically the Andover Public School System had offered to adopt the silent station for several years prior, which would have provided for an excellent non-commercial service to the Andover community, given today's lack of dial space for a new LPFM station.  The deletion of 91.7 in Andover caused two significant changes to the area's FM dialscape;  full-power commercial station 92.5 WXRV changed its community of license from Haverhill to Andover (as Andover's first/only aural broadcast service), and also co-channel 91.7 WNEF in Newburyport immediately altered it's directional signal to put more power towards Andover.  It remains to be seen if 1st adjacent station 91.5 WUML in Lowell will alter/upgrade its now-obsolete directional signal to go non-directional and put more power towards Andover.  In 1967 the Lowell station 91.5 WLTI/WJUL/WUML was originally intended to protect WPAA who began two years prior."

Waite, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who is famous for overseeing the Alabama Claims case.  Waite replaced the original Central High School when Toledo Public Schools decided it couldn't afford to have 3 high schools for the 1914-15 school year.  (Scott High School had opened in 1913.)The Waite Indians are members of the Toledo City League and their school colors are purple and gold. However, the Indian nickname is not for Native Americans.  When the school was first opened, the Toledo Fire Department had an annual competition that involved running and pulling the fire truck. The team from the East Side was called the Indians. Someone thought it would be a good idea to name the school's athletic teams after the Fire Department team.  The Indians have a rivalry with fellow East Toledo City League rival Clay. They had a football rivalry from 1914 thru 1963 with Scott High School that was played every Thanksgiving morning and generated much interest across the Midwest.  That game is now played on the final Friday of October and, with the closings of Libbey and DeVilbiss High Schools, has become once again the top rivalry for both high schools.  Waite has named their football stadium after their successful coach, Jack Mollenkopf, who also coached football at Purdue. Waite was a national high school football power in the 1920s, traveling as far as California. In 1927, they played away games on successive Fridays in Portland, Oregon and Portland, Maine. Travel was by train.  They were crowned National High School Champions in 1924 and again in 1932.  In 1924 they went 10-0 under Coach Joe Collins to win the title. In 1932, under Coach Don McCallister and Assistant Frank Pauly, they defeated Miami High School 13-7 in Miami to finish 12-0 and win the honor.The school's Latin Club functions as a local chapter of both the Ohio Junior Classical League (OJCL) and National Junior Classical League (NJCL)."

The most popular chassis is for Ford components and most are fitted with a combination of Ford Escort MkII and Ford Cortina Mk IV running gear. The original car used either Triumph or Ford Cortina Front Suspension but over the years many variations and subtle changes in chassis design have taken place. There is an option from the manufacturer for double front wishbones and coil over shocks. Any engine that fits between the chassis rails can be mounted. Depending on which engine and carburettor are fitted, various holes and bulges will have to be fitted to the bonnet.The story of the Locust Seven can be found in the book Lotus Seven & The Independents by Dennis Ortenburger  (ISBN 1-902351-12-6)"

This followed the merger of those labels' respective parent companies - the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company - to form EMI. At the merger, those records from the Regal Records catalogue were prefixed 'MR' and those from the Zonophone Records catalogue were prefixed 'T'. Record releases after the merger continued using only the 'MR' prefix.Originally Regal Zonophone handled American releases from Okeh Records, Victor Records and Columbia Records, as well as offering home-grown recordings by artists such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. The label is also known for its releases of Salvation Army (particularly brass band) music.In the 1950s the Australian division of Regal Zonophone played an important role in the emerging Australian country music genre, signing several emerging country stars including Slim Dusty, Smoky Dawson, Reg Lindsay and Chad Morgan. Slim Dusty's 1957 Regal Zonophone hit ""A Pub with No Beer"" became the biggest-selling Australian recording ever released up to that time.EMI revived the Regal Zonophone imprint in 1967 to handle the Essex Music/Straight Ahead producing account that had moved from Deram (after one Procol Harum single and two singles by the Move) and continued well into the early 1970s, with successful producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti both having production companies releasing records through the label. During this period the label had both album and single success with artists such as the Move, Joe Cocker, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Procol Harum. During the mid-1970s, many of these production deals ended and, despite a few sporadic releases by Blue Mink, Geordie, Dave Edmunds, and Grunt Futtock (a one-off project featuring Roy Wood, Steve Marriott, Peter Frampton and Andy Bown), eventually EMI ceased to use the imprint as a major pop label. Many of the label's artists moved to Fly Records or to the EMI imprint.Regal Zonophone was revived at the end of the 1990s as a reissue label curated by the UK band Saint Etienne. This incarnation of the label is no longer active, as EMI relaunched Regal and Zonophone as separate imprints of Parlophone. In 2013, both Regal and Zonophone were taken over by Warner Music Group after Universal Music Group spun off Parlophone from EMI, at the request of international regulators."

klass2,"Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product.Artists that released material on the Swan Song label during its existence included Led Zeppelin itself (including later solo releases by band members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant), Bad Company, the Pretty Things, Dave Edmunds, Mirabai, Maggie Bell (and the short-lived band she fronted, Midnight Flyer), Detective, and Sad Café. In addition to these artists, two other noted recording acts (though not signed to the label) were credited artists on Swan Song singles, both of which were UK hits in 1981: B. A. Robertson sang a duet with Maggie Bell on the single ""Hold Me"", and the Stray Cats backed Dave Edmunds on his 1981 single ""The Race Is On"".Swan Song ceased active operations in 1983 and now exists only to reissue previously released material."

The label handled artists such as Fountains of Wayne, The Inbreds, The Lemonheads (first signed to Atlantic and then moved to TAG Recordings for their album Car Button Cloth), The Bottle Rockets  and Jawbox. Due in part to poor sales of the latter band's self-titled album, as well as a corporate shakeup at Atlantic, the label was shut down in 1996 and Fountains of Wayne was transferred to Atlantic, on which they released Utopia Parkway.  The Inbreds were one of the first bands signed by TAG Recording's head of A&R, Leyla Turkkan, and their first album was Kombinator.The TAG Records name was then reestablished in 2008 by Jermaine Dupri and was sponsored by Procter & Gamble's TAG Body Spray.

A little more than a year after McCrae's hit, the record label struck gold with KC & The Sunshine Band with five #1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including ""Get Down Tonight"", ""That's the Way I Like It"", ""Shake Your Booty"", ""I'm Your Boogie Man"" and ""Please Don't Go"", while ""Keep It Coming Love"" topped the R&B chart as well.Subsidiary labels included Wolf and Bold  –  and other artists which impacted these and TK, include: Betty Wright (on Alston), Clarence Reid, a.k.a.

The last single to be released on the TK label was ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's ""Another One Rides the Bus"". When Morris Levy was forced to leave the country in 1986, Henry Stone formed Hot Productions with Paul Klein and continued to re-release the TK catalog on CD until its acquisition by Rhino Records a division of Warner Music Group."

klass2,"Taito of Brazil (in Portuguese Taito Do Brasil) was a pinball and arcade manufacturer located in São Paulo, Brazil. The company originally started out as Clover Electronic Amusement in 1968, then became Taito Do Brasil in 1972 by Abraham ""Abba"" Kogan, the son of the founder of the parent company Taito Corporation located in Japan. This subsidiary was originally an importer of existing U.S. and Japanese machine components to be assembled within the country. However, the taxation on imports had been growing steadily, and the government's belief that pinball is a game of chance and considered a gambling machine, led to strict import rules. By 1976, within rules created by the Electronic Processing Activities Coordinating Committee (CAPRE), it became illegal to import pinball machines. This created a problem, since the popularity of arcade games in Brazil had been growing exponentially for many years.In 1978, with an influx of cash from the parent company, Taito of Brazil was able to build new facilities to accommodate the new standard of electronic solid state games being produced by other manufacturers. Because of the import changes, companies in Brazil needed to become innovative, and began creating imitations, or close representations of already existing products that could no longer be acquired. This included pinball and arcade games. Taito of Brazil began creating games by copying existing designs of successful pinball machines made elsewhere. Where some games were nearly identical in a physical sense, others had greatly altered artwork. In most cases of games created to look like their counterparts made by other manufacturers, the machine name was changed, sound effects altered, and often went through a modification of game rules. Such was the case with a Taito made game called, Oba Oba. The playfield layout was a copy of Bally Playboy but with altered artwork, and now based on a playhouse located in Rio de Janeiro. Where others were much closer to the original games, such as the case with Drakor, which is nearly identical to Gorgar from Williams Electronics. Taito of Brazil's most commercially successful pinball machine was, Cosmic, a clone of Stern Electronics, Galaxy.Additionally, starting in the late 1970s, Taito of Brazil began creating arcade game clones known as bootlegs as well. The only hardware available to them was an arcade board originally created by Japanese company, Nichibutsu for a game called, Moon Cresta (1980). Bootleg versions of existing games were altered to run on this hardware. Other minor changes were implemented to the software code including text, and sound effects. In total, 21 different adaptations had been produced, including popular games such as, Zig Zag, a redeployment of Dig Dug from Namco, and Missile X, a clone of Missile Command from Atari.Taito of Brazil closed its doors in 1985 after a series of unfortunate events. Michael Kogan, the founder of the parent company, Taito Corporation had died on a business trip to the U.S. in early 1984. This left much of the control of the Japanese Taito Corporation to the company employees, who were less enthusiastic about its subsidiaries. This added to a sharp decrease in the popularity of pinball worldwide as the result of the popularity of arcade video games prompted the decision to close down Taito of Brazil in 1985. The company was liquidated and all its debts honored without the need for bankruptcy. Kyocera of Japan purchased what remained of the Taito Corporation in 1986."

klass2,"Target Books was a British publishing imprint, established in 1973 by Universal-Tandem Publishing Co Ltd, a paperback publishing company. The imprint was established as a children's imprint to complement the adult Tandem imprint, and became well known for their highly successful range of novelisations and other assorted books based on the popular science-fiction television series Doctor Who. Their first publications based on the serial were reprints in paperback of three novels which had been previously published as hardbacks, ‘Doctor Who and the Daleks’, ‘Doctor Who and the Crusaders’ by David Whitaker, and ‘Doctor Who and the Zarbi’ by Bill Strutton.  As these sold well further novelisations of the show were commissioned. In 1975 Universal-Tandem was sold by its American owners, the Universal-Award group, to the British conglomerate Howard and Wyndham. The company was renamed Tandem Publishing Ltd before being merged with the paperback imprints of Howard and Wyndham's general publishing house W. H. Allen Ltd to become Wyndham Publications Ltd in 1976. However, during 1977 and 1978 the Wyndham identity was phased out and, until 1991, Target books were published by 'the paperback division of WH Allen & Co.'The most prolific writer in the Doctor Who range was Terrance Dicks, while actor turned writer Ian Marter, Malcolm Hulke, Philip Hinchcliffe and Nigel Robinson (who was for a time the editor of the range) were also contributors.Almost every story from the Doctor Who series was produced in novelisation form; the exceptions being three scripts by Douglas Adams (Shada, The Pirate Planet and City of Death) and two by Eric Saward (Resurrection of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks). Saward was reluctant to novelise these scripts himself due to the large percentage of the author's royalties demanded by the agents of the creator of the Daleks, Terry Nation, for the inclusion of the creatures, and other writers were dissuaded for the same reason. Adams, when interviewed on video about his involvement with Doctor Who, stated that he was unhappy with the standard one-off fee offered by Target Books for the novelisations saying ""I do have this tendency to be a best-selling author"".  The estate of Douglas Adams eventually permitted a novelisation of Shada to be produced in 2011.  It was written by Gareth Roberts and published by BBC Books in 2012.The company also produced novelisations of various other films and television series, again aimed mostly at the child and teenage markets. They also published a number of original children's and teenage novels. In 1973, the company produced a successful paperback edition of Tim Dinsdale's book, The Story of the Loch Ness Monster. In 1977, Target published the novelisation of the Ray Harryhausen film, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger.WH Allen was purchased by the Virgin Group in the late 1980s and changed its name to Virgin Publishing in 1991. According to the On Target website (see link below), the Target Books line was retired on new books following the publication of Victor Pemberton's Doctor Who - The Pescatons in the autumn of 1991.However, when Virgin Books later published novelisations of the serials The Evil of the Daleks and The Power of the Daleks, and an adaptation of the radio play The Paradise of Death, the books were identified as being part of the Target series on their title pages; The Paradise of Death, published in April 1994 as No. 156 in the ""Doctor Who Library"", was the last book to be connected to Target. Reprints of the older novelisations with new covers were published until March 1994, using the Target name.Further novelisations of Doctor Who-related productions were published by Virgin under the New Adventures and Missing Adventures lines (including an adaptation of the BBC Radio play The Ghosts of N-Space and the independently produced spin-offs Downtime and Shakedown: Return of the Sontarans), while BBC Books would later adapt the 1996 TV-movie, the 2003 webcast, Scream of the Shalka and, in March 2012, the unbroadcast story, Shada.In 2011 BBC Books published reprints of several of the Target Doctor Who novelisations."

The bulk of the operations was from the old Parking Authority of Toronto, established in the old city of Toronto in 1952.According to the Toronto Parking Authority website in 2005, it operates 160 municipal parking lots containing about 20,000 spaces. Twenty of these lots accounting for approximately 10,000 spaces are garages. The remaining 10,000 spaces are contained in approximately 140 surface lots. Parking lots that are operated by the Toronto Parking Authority are marked with green signs with their signature P in the middle, hence, ""Green P"" parking.In late 2005 and throughout 2006, the TPA began the process of automating many of their surface carparks, notably Carparks 5, 12, 39, 49, and 58. Equipping these carparks allows the TPA to operate these lots on a 24-hour basis. They are operated by cashiers during the day during peak business hours and then are run by exit pay stations later on at night. The exit pay stations accept coins and credit cards only as a method of payment. Yet despite being in place for over a year and having numerous signs around the parking lot at the entrance and exits, customers are still dumbfounded by the fact that ""they can't pay cash"" at the exit stations. This has led to several problems including (but not limited to) broken gates, tailgating, bills inserted into the credit card slot at the exit, into the coin slot at the exit and even bills left in the change dispenser at the exit. By September 2006, Carpark 29 will become a fully automated parking garage where customers make payments at the designated pay stations rather than to the cashiers. Automating the car parks has reduced the need for part-time student staff.2007 marked the end of Maurice Anderson's tenure as president of the Toronto Parking Authority.

klass2,"Ultra Food & Drug was a supermarket and drug store chain in Ontario, Canada from the 1980s to 2008.It was begun in the 1980s as Miracle Ultra Mart, and was an attempt by the Miracle Mart department store and Miracle Food Mart supermarket chains to expand. Both chains were owned by Steinberg's Stores, a Quebec-based supermarket chain.When Steinberg's Ontario grocery operations were acquired by A&P Canada in 1990, the Miracle Food Mart stores continued to operate under their former banner until eventually being converted to A&P Canada's ""A&P"" and ""Dominion"" banners. A&P Canada continued the Miracle Ultra Mart banner as Ultra Mart, before changing its name to Ultra Food & Drug in the mid-1990s. The Miracle Mart department stores (rebranded ""M"" by the time) were not included in this transaction, and remained part of Steinburg until they were closed when the company went bankrupt in 1992.Ultra Food & Drug returned to ownership by a Quebec company in 2006 when A&P Canada was acquired by Metro Inc.  Up and until this date, A&P Canada had left the Ultra Food & Drug banner alone.  It was well noted in the communities of the Ultra stores that A&P owned and operated the Ultra stores.  Many customers who had grown up in the Toronto area were familiar with and happy to shop at Dominion stores.  The relationship between the A&P, Dominion and Ultra banners remained strong and customers came to expect the same experience when visiting any of the three banners.  Many customers who would travel to other areas of Ontario from Toronto would notice the similar design and branding as the Dominion stores.  The Ultra banners were primarily found outside of the GTA, specifically in Guelph, Oakville/Burlington, Brampton (Bramalea), as well as some eastern Ontario cities such as Belleville, Ontario.  The Ultra banner store sales were a significant portion of A&P Canada's revenues, and the stores seemed to ""survive on their own,"" with little management.Although many of the Ultra stores had ""above average store sales,"" some of the Ultra stores were known to outperform many of the A&P and Dominion stores, primarily the Ultra Food&Drug store located at Stone Road and Edinburgh in Guelph.  The Guelph Ultra store was known by many at A&P's head office as being a market leader.  The Guelph store had fierce competition from Zehrs Markets, a division of Loblaws, Inc.  The Ultra store opened in Guelph on February 13 1997 and maintained a healthy market share, primarily because of the noticeable customer service over their competitors.  Guelph's store employed a number of high school and University of Guelph students that took on customer service head-on under the leadership of the store management.  Many of these students were allotted power and authorization not seen in any of A&P's other stores.  This focus on customer service was initially seen as critical in order to make the store successful.  While customer service was critical to the success of the Guelph store, the store was also well known for being open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - something no other grocer in the city of Guelph offered.  The Guelph store was also seen regularly participating in local community events such as the Santa Clause Parade, Guelph's July 1 celebrations at Riverside Park, Heart and Strokes Big Bike event (a bicycle built for 30 people) as well as 365 days a year bin drop off for the Guelph Food Bank.On August 7, 2008, Metro announced it will invest $200 million consolidating the company's conventional food stores under the Metro banner.  Over a period of 15 months, all Dominion, A&P, Loeb, the Barn and Ultra banners were converted to be Metro; the Food Basics brand was retained in the discount food segment. The final three Ultra Food and Drug locations were converted by November 14, 2008."
klass2,"Ultra Software Corporation was a shell corporation and publishing label created in 1988 as a subsidiary of Konami of America, in an effort to get around Nintendo of America's strict licensing rules for the North American Konami release games for Nintendo consoles. One of these rules was that a third-party company could only publish up to five games per year for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US. This was hardly convenient for Konami, which had begun releasing more than ten games a year for both the Family Computer and Family Computer Disk System in Japan. With a greater library than they were allowed to localize, Konami formed the Ultra Games brand to extend their annual library to ten games a year.Ultra's first game was the NES version of Metal Gear. At first, Ultra was dedicated to localizing Konami's pre-existing software from Japan, but later they began publishing works from other companies as well. Some of Konami's most notable games released under the Ultra label include Operation C (an original Game Boy installment of the Contra series), Snake's Revenge (a sequel to the original Metal Gear) and the first few Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games for the NES and Game Boy.After the North American launch of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo became less strict on the number of games third parties could publish. As a result, Ultra Games began losing its purpose and Konami dropped the label in 1992.In Europe, Konami established the Palcom Software Limited subsidiary for similar purposes. Their library was similar to Ultra's (also including SNES games published by Konami itself), but the company also published games that were not released in America, notably Road Fighter, Parodius, Crackout, and Pop'n Twinbee. The European subsidiary lasted longer than Ultra Games, until it was closed down in early 1994."

It is involved in the production and distribution of evangelistic films, the production of Graham crusade films, and publicity for Graham crusades.WWP got its start after Graham met Dick Ross, who had produced a documentary film of Graham's 1950 crusade in Portland, Oregon.  That film's success led the BGEA to buy Ross's production company, and hire him as the president of a new BGEA subsidiary incorporated as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Film Ministry (which was to be WWP's official name until 1980).WWP's first feature film was Mr. Texas, produced during Graham's 1951 Fort Worth, Texas Crusade.

On his death, the property went to his daughter, the then Mrs. David Castleman who eventually built a mansion on the horse farm site and gave it the family name. Under Mr. & Mrs. Castleman, Castleton Farm continued as a thoroughbred operation but would add the breeding of American Saddlebreds as well as Standardbreds for harness racing.The original property changed hands several times with parts sold to different parties. In the early 1890s Wall Street tycoon James R. Keene acquired the farm and purchased additional land to bring the operation to almost 1,000 acres (4 km²). Keene usually referred to the farm as ""Castleton Stud"" and under his direction it became one of the greatest thoroughbred operations of its day. The farm bred and/or raced future U.S. racing Hall of Fame horses Kingston, Domino, Ben Brush, Colin, Sysonby, Maskette, and Peter Pan.As part of a program honoring important horse racing tracks and racing stables, the Pennsylvania Railroad named its baggage car #5865 the ""Castleton Farm"".Upon the death of James R. Keene in 1913, the farm was taken over by his son Foxhall P. Keene. He continued the operation on a slightly reduced basis but sold it in the 1920s to fellow New Yorker, David Look. Look would have considerable success in harness racing but was forced to sell the farm after experiencing personal financial setbacks during the Great Depression.In the early 1940s, heiress Frances Dodge founded the Dodge Stable. She was the daughter of Michigan automobile pioneer John F. Dodge and a half-sister of Isabel Dodge, owner of the highly successful Brookmeade Stable. In 1945, Frances Dodge, with her husband (polo player and hunter/jumper rider) James B. ""Jimmy"" Johnson, purchased Castleton Farm and relocated her Dodge stables there. Their standardbred  breeding operation included two  Hambletonian  and a Little Brown Jug  winner.  After she married Pennsylvia native Fredrick Van Lennep in 1949, the farm underwent major renovations in order to breed and raise  standardbreds. The Van Lenneps made Castleton Farm one of the preeminent operations in both disciplines. Under Mrs. Johnson,  Dodge Stables'  show horse Wing Commander became a six-time World Grand Champion and with her husband, she enjoyed enormous success in harness racing that included a number of Hambletonian and Little Brown Jug victories from horses such as ""Harness Horse of the Year"" winner Victory Song (1947), Hambletonian winners,  Hoot Mon (1947) and Emily's Pride (1958) and Speedy Scot (1963). Among the other noteworthy Castleton harness horses were Strike Out and  Little Brown Jug winner (1948) Ensign Hanover.In 2001, Irish businessman and racing enthusiast Tony Ryan acquired Castleton Farm from the Van Lennep Family Trust. Ryan renamed it Castleton Lyons and undertook renovations to the property while returning to its original roots as a thoroughbred operation."

Born in Rehovot, Israel on April 7, 1963, he grew up in Jerusalem where his father, Shlomo Alexander, was a professor of physics at the UCLA and the Hebrew University and his mother, Esther Alexander, was an economist and social activist.  He obtained a B.S. from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 1988 in mathematics and history, before moving to the United States, where he obtained an M.A. in history of science from Stanford University in 1990, and a Ph.D. in history of science from Stanford University in 1996.His first book, Geometrical Landscapes: The Voyages of Discovery and the Transformation of Mathematical Practice, was published in 2002.  The book describes the 17th century English exploration of the Americas, the early exploration by English mathematicians of infinitesimals, and the relationship between the two, and argued that ""If a strong relationship can be established between an historically specific nonmathematical tale and the narrative of a mathematical work that originated within its social sphere, then mathematics can indeed be said to be fundamentally shaped by its social and cultural setting.""His second book, Duel at Dawn: Heroes, Martyrs, and the Rise of Modern Mathematics, was published in 2010.  The book begins describing the death of Evariste Galois in a duel in 1832 and makes the argument that the ideas and culture of the Romantic age influenced the way mathematicians saw themselves and the very mathematics that they created.His third book, Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World was published in 2014.  The book returns to the topic of the history of the study of infinitesimals in the 17th century, and locates arguments about the validity of the mathematical concept in the struggles between Roman Catholics and Protestants in the Reformation and Counter-Reformation and the accompanying political struggles between authoritarian and more pluralistic approaches to governing.  Infinitesimal was selected as one of the best science books of 2014 by Library Journal and by Slate magazine.Alexander has also contributed pieces to The New York Times's Science and Book Reviews sections, The Los Angeles Times Op-Ed section, and Scientific American, and he has been interviewed on NPR's All Things Considered, and Interfaith Voices.Amir Alexander lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two children.

The great edifices of the realm, past and present, have always conveyed a sense of power, which fails to dwindle with the passing centuries. Even the overgrown foundations of a long demolished country house hold a melancholic power as does the shattered body of a great abbey.”The thorough research and persistent evolution of Kluz's works has brought about experimentation and innovation with various media . His earlier work explored the material qualities of egg tempera and gum Arabic on gessoed panels. Most recently he has developed a distinctive paper collage technique which makes use of hand coloured papers and mixed media. He also produces screen prints and lino cuts.Kluz has stated that he believes in the role of the ""artist as designer and embraces all forms of image making"", which includes printmaking, textile design, illustration and painting."

Yet, 20 days later, he stood on the sideline with his team as Texas defeated Notre Dame in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic on New Year's Day. His fight against cancer inspired the United States Congress to write the National Cancer Act of 1971 and President Richard Nixon to sign it into law, thus beginning the ""War on Cancer"". In 1971, with the help of Dallas Times Herald sports editor, Blackie Sherrod, Steinmark wrote and published his autobiography I Play to Win.

His preferred media are drawing, graphic arts, photography, computer drawings, painting and glass painting, sculpture (wood, iron, aluminium, concrete). Since the end of the Eighties, Zogmayer has created art projects that inhabit space in various architectural and urban contexts (New York; Vienna, St. Veit/Salzburg, St. Pölten/Austria; Sonnenhausen, Tübingen/Germany), bordering on design. He has made work for a number of liturgical places, e. g. in churches (Brussels/Belgium; Frankfurt, Bonn, Aschaffenburg/Germany; Graz, Innsbruck/Austria). Between 1998 und 2000 he led a class for aesthetics in space at the International Summer Academy at Topolcianky/Slovakia.Around 1990 Zogmayer came off the narrative, mimetic, and expressive components of his previous art, realised as painting, drawing, and prints. He then creates objects applied to the wall or set in a room, based on clear stereometric forms which he combines to site-specific installations.By the mid-Nineties he radicalised the reductive process in his works, his paintings become the site for words and texts. In his glass paintings single words or short sentences are left free-standing in a monochrome colour surface,alternatively, they are engraved in rectangular blocks and cylinders, objects made of aluminium or steel, as well as being realised as large-format installations in public spaces.Zogmayer´s art deals with different subjects, such as the aesthetic concept of the “beautiful”, its rehabilitation as well as its rejuvenation; furthermore he initiates intercultural discourses, addresses art and spirituality, and maintains a reductive and iconoclastic aesthetic."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Hanford_Ford","Mary Hanford Ford (November 1, 1856 – February 2, 1937) was an American lecturer, author, art and literature critic and a leader in the women's suffrage movement. She reached early notoriety in Kansas at the age of 28 and soon left for the Chicago World's Fair. She was taken up by the society ladies of the Chicago area who, impressed with her talks on art and literature at the Fair, helped launch her on a new career, initially in Chicago and then across some States. Along the way she was already published in articles and noticed in suffrage meetings. In addition to work as an art critic and speaker she wrote a number of books, most prominently a trilogy Message of the Mystics. Circa 1900-1902 Ford found the Bahá'í Faith through Sarah Farmer, Green Acre, and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and helped form the first community of Bahá'ís in Boston where Louis Bourgeois, future architect of the first Bahá'í House of Worship in the West, then joined the religion. In 1907 Ford went on Bahá'í pilgrimage, in 1910 she started writing Bahá'í books such as The Oriental Rose, and traveled with `Abdu'l-Bahá during some of his journeys in various places in Europe and then America. Ford spent the years of World War I in California following the first Bahá'í International Congress at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, and then moved back to New York where she spent almost the next 20 years. In this period she was censored off a radio broadcast, helped develop the religion's community both in meetings she supported and literary efforts, and traveled in Europe for the religion, before reducing her travels and speaking engagements in the early 30s. She died with her daughter by her bedside in 1937."

In 2009, he underwent further studies at the Nigerian Law School where he obtained the qualification to become a Barrister at Law in Nigeria in 2010.The 37-year-old lawmaker had a humble upbringing by Christian parents who both worked in Nigeria's Civil Service. Many give his mother, Deaconess Lawrencia Luke, the credit for Onofiok's moral high ground.After a 3-year engagement with Governor Godswill Akpabio as Personal Assistant, Onofiok was nominated to the Nigerian Youth Parliament where he was later elected as the pioneer Speaker of the 109-member Parliament, a non-stipendiary institution put together by then President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua to help generate inputs from elite Nigerian youths into the country's mainstream governance.In 2011, Onofiok won sufficient votes at the primaries of the People's Democratic Party (Nigeria) to run in that year's general election for a seat to represent Nsit Ubium state constituency in the Akwa Ibom state House of Assembly.Onofiok is still seen as a rights activist although in recent years, he has played less activist roles as he becomes more deeply involved in leadership at both national and state levels.His activism gained national prominence when he served as President of the Student Union Government of the University of Uyo. Onofiok led a mass student protest against the university management which had increased school fees and other sundry charges for students of the institution without justification. Onofiok, like many other students he led at the time, believed that being a government-funded institution, the arbitrary increase in fees by the University of Uyo was callous and uncalled for.Other displeased students from across Nigeria who were in solidarity with Onofiok and the University of Uyo students joined the protest.Following the peaceful protest he led, one still seen as a rare bravery, the university management rusticated Onofiok Luke for two years. But after having been found clean of every allegation by the school, Onofiok was recalled later to complete his studies for a degree in Law.Onofiok's boldness, erudition, and principles have earned him the respect of many of Nigeria's youths. He is an alumnus of the Harvard Business School Executive Education programme and an Honorary Texan.Luke, in 2011, became an associate member of the Nigeria Leadership Initiative (NLI), an international non-profit platform for credible, accomplished and uniquely patriotic Nigerians.

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Webster_Kehr","Robert Webster Kehr (born 7 October 1946 in Jefferson City, Missouri) is an amateur American author and promoter. Claiming since 2002 to be a sort of ""cancer researcher (of natural medicine),"" he holds a belief in so-called creation science and maintains a website promoting cancer quackery and discouraging cancer patients from seeking medical health care. Kehr is also a conspiracy theorist who claims that the medical profession and drug companies are deliberately suppressing so-called cures for cancer. Now retired, he served in Vietnam with the United States Marine Corps, where he was seriously wounded, and formerly was vice-president of an insurance company and of a market research company and, until December 2012, was a civilian contractor for the United States Army at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.Kehr claims he began looking into alternative cancer treatments while stationed in Germany in 2002, after experiencing some discomfort with a drug prescribed for his hypertension. In a fawning YouTube interview with Judy Seeger, a non-doctor who does not challenge his conspiracy theories and who blames medical doctors for ""tricking"" people into accepting needed chemotherapy, he says he'd heard about the United States Department of Energy supposedly suppressing solutions to a United States energy crisis, claims to know ""exactly what's going on inside cancer cells,"" praises the use of laetrile — an ineffective but dangerous anti-cancer drug that was fraudulently labelled as a vitamin in order to circumvent a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ban on shipping the chemical across state lines — and Protandim, a heavily marketed and overpriced pill that supposedly can increase antioxidant activity but which, he claims, he is not allowed by the manufacturer to recommend on his website.Kehr also promotes a health fraud scheme involving ""consultations"" with Gary Teal, a pyramid seller of ""JWLabs or GB-4000 Rife machines"" designed to generate high frequency radio waves whose carrier frequencies supposedly can cure cancer. Typically, machines are sold through distributors in a multi-level marketing scheme. Although the Rife machine was thoroughly discredited by the health profession in the 1950s, as recently as 2007 a Mount Vernon, Washington couple who secretly treated patients with an illegal ""Rife device"" claiming to cure numerous diseases, including cancer and AIDS, were convicted of felony health fraud. The husband, Donald Brandt, had impersonated a medical doctor, and the wife, Sharon Brandt, had arranged appointments. At least one patient, a 32-year-old, had refused needed surgery for testicular cancer and had instead, over a year, spent several thousand dollars on fraudulent ""energy treatments"" before dying from his formerly treatable cancer. Then in 2009 James Folsom was convicted of 26 felony counts relating to the sale of the unapproved RF frequency generators.

In these works one can trace ""current and historic moments and identities are fused together onto the canvas, producing a hybrid state of uncharted territory"".In an interview published by Hyde Park Art Center she states: “Having run away from seemingly inadequate definitions for abstract painting, I find myself immersed in a relationship that tracks, exchanges, and shreds the world of news, front-page photography, design, and pictorial memory into a subject-less pictorial mash-up. In essence, there is no more picture; there is only painting.”Other well known works by Alvarez include Recollections: Works on Paper by Candida Alvarez & Vincent D.

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carol_Gregory","Carol Jean Gregory (born November 10, 1943) is an American politician of the Democratic Party. Gregory was appointed to the Washington House of Representatives by Governor Jay Inslee on January 8, 2015 to the vacant state representative seat in the 30th Legislative District left after the death of Representative Roger Freeman on October 29, 2014. She was sworn in with the rest of the Washington State Legislature on January 12, 2015.After two unsuccessful campaigns to represent the 30th District in the Legislature in 2008 and 2010, Gregory was invited to run in 2013 for School Board against parochial school principal Medgar Wells, which was successful. A month after election, she was selected by the Board as School Board President, but stepped down in 2015 after being nominated to replace Roger Freeman, who died days before winning re-election, in the State Legislature. She retains her position on the Federal Way School Board, while the role of board president moved to Geoffery McAnalloy.State law in Washington allows the political party that officially nominated a legislator of a legislative district to nominate three replacements for a vacancy in that legislator's position. Freeman's death near the end of the 2014 election cycle was the first such instance since the state's ""top-two"" primary system, which replaced the traditional party primary system. On December 1, 2014, the Washington State Democrats held a nominating convention of 30th District party members in Federal Way, which selected, in order of descending priority: Gregory, local party official Richard Champion, and unsuccessful 2014 State Senate candidate Shari Song as nominees. Under the law, the municipal County Councils of the county or counties in which the legislative district lies shall vote on which the three nominees shall fill the vacancy. The King County Council voted on December 8, 2014 to select Carol Gregory. However, the Pierce County Council objected to the King County vote, to which it was not party, arguing that the vote must be done by both County Councils at a combined assembly, while King County disagreed. Pierce County refused to hold their own vote, demanding that King County arrange a combined meeting. The impasse was resolved on January 8, 2015, when the responsibility then passed to Governor Jay Inslee, who selected Gregory.In the case of vacancies filled before the middle of an electoral term, the appointment must be confirmed via an off-year mid-term election. In early 2015, Federal Way City Council member and political consultant Martin Moore, who had served as legislative aide to Freeman and previously a Democrat, announced his intention to run for the position as a Republican. Moore withdrew from the race after local Chamber of Commerce official Teri Hickel announced her candidacy, also as a Republican. Due to state laws preventing state legislators from campaigning while the legislature is in session, Gregory was left at a disadvantage after the State Legislature went into two special sessions over state budget battles, particularly in light of McCleary v Washington regarding state education funding, during which time Gregory's campaign was unable to raise or spend money outside of a few days between sessions. Hickel beat Gregory in the 2015 August top-two primary—a vestigial formality as only the two candidates were running—by 2.5 percentage points in an election with a 27% voter turnout.The winner of the 2015 election will also face a 2016 election for a subsequent full term.Prior to her political career, Gregory was the director of BuRSST for Prosperity, a nonprofit association which works to elevate people out of poverty. She served as president of the Washington Education Association teachers' union from 1975–1981, and president of the Washington chapter of womens' rights group NARAL."

He concluded his studies in Mexico with a concert at Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. In 1973 he performed as a soloist in Bergen, Norway, with Slovak Chamber Orchestra. In 1974 he performed Bach's catalog in London to notable acclaim. From 1972 to '76 he was a professor at Prague Conservatory. His instrument is a Masaru Kohno Luthier, Tokyo, Model 20 1974 (string length: 660mm).In 1970, on return to Czechoslovakia from Mexico, Večtomov formed Prague String Duo with his brother, cellist Saša Večtomov. The duo's many appearances outside Czechoslovakia—filing concert halls in the USSR, USA, Great Britain, Mexico, Norway, Portugal and many other countries—established them internationally. A salient feature of the duo's repertory was its focus on Iberian composers, whom they favored owing to the national character of the accompanying instrument and the fact that Vladimír had for years studied on a Mexican government scholarship under guitarist Prof. Manuel López Ramos in Mexico City. In addition to old masters (e.g., Haydn, Eccles, Maria Theresia von Paradis), and modern and sometimes local ones (Granados, Janáček), the brothers Večtomov performed music by contemporary composers including their father, Prof. Ivan Večtomov, who, moreover, orchestrated all of Prague String Duo's arrangements. According to Mexican journalist Isabel Farfán Cano, Janáček's Fairy Tale was a brilliant staple of the duo's concert programs. Further, writes Cano of a particular concert in 1976, ""the harmony of both instruments in creating sound coloration and tones was complemented by technical security, gradual and protruding.""Phonograph recordings of Večtomov have been issued on the Supraphon, Panton, and Melodiya labels.In 1982 Večtomov accepted an invitation to join the faculty of Keski-Suomen konservatorio (later renamed Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu), in Jyväskylä, Finland, where he continued to teach until 1998. He then returned to Prague and taught at Základní Umělecká Škola Lounských."

Of lowly social origin and a recipient of Hasidic education, he became a noted cultural activist, polemicist, and newspaper founder, remembered primarily for his Mântuirea daily. By the end of World War I, he emerged as a theorist of Religious Zionism, preferring communitarianism and self-segregation to the assimilationist option, while also promoting literary modernism in his activity as novelist, dramatist, and cultural sponsor. He was the inspiration behind the Jewish Party, which competed with the mainstream Union of Romanian Jews for the Jewish vote. Zissu and Union leader Wilhelm Filderman had a lifelong disputation over religious and practical politics.Always a confrontational critic of antisemitism, Zissu found himself marginalized by fascist regimes in the late 1930s and for most of World War II. During the Holocaust era, he risked his personal freedom to defend the interests of his community, and was especially vocal as a critic of the collaborationist Central Jewish Office. He eventually reached a compromise with the Ion Antonescu regime when the latter curbed its deportations of Jews to Transnistria, and, after 1943, helped initiate the Aliyah Bet exodus of Romanian and Hungarian Jews to Mandatory Palestine. His contribution is at the center of an enduring controversy, focusing on his alleged favoritism of Zionist Jews and his cantankerousness.In his final years, Zissu's Zionism merged with explicit anti-communism, clashing directly with the Romanian Communist Party's anti-cosmopolitan agenda. His renewed effort to ensure the mass emigration of Romanian Jews, and his contacts with Israel, made him a target for the communist regime: in 1951, he was arrested, and, in 1954, sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of high treason. He was amnestied after some two years in prison, where he had been tortured and brutalized. Himself an emigrant, he died shortly after resettling in Israel."

Division of Entomology; Merriam hired Fisher to help establish this new Branch. In 1886 the Branch was elevated to Division status and named the ""Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy"". The goal of the Division was to perform food-habit studies of wildlife and to educate farmers about the usefulness to farmers of some birds and mammals among wildlife. In 1896 the Division was granted independent status with expanded duties as a new Division and named the ""Division of Biological Survey."" A U.S. Congressional Act of 3 March 1905 enabled the creation on 1 July 1905 of a separate Bureau of Biological Survey. Fisher worked for the Bureau from its inception until his retirement in 1931.Fisher participated in the Death Valley Expedition in 1891, the Harriman Alaska Expedition in 1899, and the Pinchot South Seas Expedition in 1929. Many bird skins collected by Fisher on these 3 expeditions are now in the National Museum of Natural History.He was the president of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1914–1917. He wrote 150 papers on ornithology or other zoological subjects with a few obituaries. A list of his papers, complete to 21 March 1926, was published in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington.Fisher had a wife and two sons and two daughters. He played an important role in conservation movements and was a personal friend of several famous conservationists, including Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt.

As a result, as a result he refused to participate  in the Whitney Museum of Art's landmark exhibition' Contemporary Black Artists in America.His work has been associated with the De Stijl movement often containing strong design elements, inspired by Cubism and the simplicity of Piet Mondrian. His  worked moved from semi-abstract landscapes in the 1940s and 1950s to geometric abstracts. Aa Hines became more influenced by American modernists- such as Stuart Davis, Ad Reinhardt, Josef Albers, Elsworth Kelly, and Barnett Newman, he began to eliminate line from his compositions, focusing instead on simple shapes and a restrained color palette.His works are included in several collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum Renwick Gallery  including: ""Yellow and Gray"", 1976, oil on linen, (Gift of Barbara Fiedler Gallery, 1978.128, ""Red Stripe with Green Background"", 1986 oil on linen, ( Gift of Dorothy C Fisher, 2011.25.2,Abstract landscape , oil on linen, Gift of Dorothy C.

Batting at number three for Rangoon Gymkhana, behind an ex-first-class player in Basil Eddis, Garnett scored 126, though his century was not enough to prevent his team losing by 38 runs. For All-Burma, making only its second recorded appearance (and first since 1894), he came in fifth in the batting line-up, and scored 81, partnering with FitzAlan Drayson, who scored 137, to help Burma to an innings victory. Garnett remained in Burma until at least as late as December 1914, when he played for Rangoon Gymkhana in the Calcutta Triangular tournament, opening the batting with George Forrester, an ex-Oxford University player.Unlike in most other cricket-playing countries, first-class cricket continued largely unabated in India during the First World War. Garnett made his first-class debut in the 1917–18 edition of the Bombay Quadrangular, scoring a half-century, 54, for the Europeans team against the Parsees. He went on to play matches in three out of the next four tournaments, with his final appearance coming in November 1921, during the 1921–22 edition. Garnett's one other first-class appearance had come in November 1918, when he played for ""England"" against ""India"" in a mock Test match celebrating the signing of the armistice to halt the war. His opening partner in that match was Harry Lee, a future England Test player, although he was the only past or present England Test player in the team. Garnett died in Calcutta in November 1933, aged only 52."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gasparo_Scaruffi","Gasparo Scaruffi (1519–1584), from Reggio Emilia was an Italian economist who proposed a universal currency in order to facilitate an open, objective and just economic system, which, he argued, was the essential foundation of a just society.Scaruffi was the youngest of Antonio di Gianfrancesco de’ Baldicelli’s seven children. Although a nobleman, Antonio was wealthy because of his activities as a merchant of spices, textiles, and haberdashery, and he left a substantial inheritance to all his children. The first records of Scaruffi's activities as an adult show him in Piacenza in 1544 as a businessman and money exchanger. In 1547, he was appointed as an assayer at the mint of Reggio by the council, eventually becoming the mint's manager (in 1552), and ultimately a spenditore (treasurer) to the council. In 1550 he travelled to the Duchy of Mantova to advocate the value of coins minted in Reggio – based on their gold content – against their devaluation in Mantova, which had been declared by a grida (fiat) of Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga. He continued to Parma, where he convinced the Duke, Ottavio Farnese, of the value of Reggio's curreny without assay, but through logic and reason alone. In 1576 he likewise went as an ambassador to the Duchy of Ferrara. Through his experiences of the economic practices of different Italian duchies, and his activities assaying Italian and foreign coins, Scaruffi became convinced that the number and variation of coins in circulation, as well as arbitrary practices such as devaluation, only served to obstruct trade, and subject merchants and governors alike to excessive and unnecessary complications and negotiations. To solve these problems, he proposed a currency whose value would be universal through being based on the intrinsic value of its precious metal content.Scaruffi published his ideas in a book entitled L’Alitinonfo (from the Ancient Greek for ""True Light""), published in Reggio by Hercoliano Bartoli in 1582. This book argued not just for a universal currency, but for a society based on objective action in the light of a natural law. He saw the businessman, who seeks his goals through rational means, taking objective regard of opportunities and hindrances, and indifferent to sentiment, as the model for how all transactions and social relations should occur. He denigrated the aribtrary rule of princes, especially those who ruled extravaganty while their populaces suffered famines and other calamities, and argued that rational justice should apply to all. In L'Alitinonfo, the argument for a universal coinage based on intrinsic value and not subject to the whims of princes or the negotiaitons of merchants becomes a metaphor for an economy and society also based on universal standards of objectivity and justice.Scaruffi, influenced by the notion of a natural law, mistakenly believed precious metals to have intrinsic values, rather than also being goods that have an exchange value. However, in many other ways his picture of an economy based on transparency and fair negotiation, his more extended ideas on society and justice, and the very notion of a universal currency, were very far-seeing. How much his ideas influenced other economists, of his own or later eras, is unclear, but in themselves his views represent a clear step forward from mercantilism towards a more modern conception of economics."

In 1729 Franz Wolff married Inger Brunn, and the couple had six children.By 1759 Gerog had moved to London and worked as an assistant for Jens Pedersen, the owner of a timber export business. The company was part of a small Danish-Norwegian community centred around Wellclose Square. Most residents were involved in the export of Norwegian timber to London, a trade which, following the Great Fire of London in 1666, had become a booming business. In 1760 Wolff married Elizabeth Gorham, an 18-year-old English woman from St Neots. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Martha Ann, and one son, Jens. In June 1770 the elder Elizabeth died. Wolff later married Sarah Cheesement, who bore him two additional daughters, Sarah Augusta, and Inger Maria. Following Sarah's death in 1790, Wolff never remarried. Though he was raised Lutheran, while in London Wolff became a Methodist and was close friends with John Wesley.After serving Pedersen for a time, in 1767 Gerog was joined in London by his brother, Ernst Wolff, and the two established Geo. & Ernst Wolff at No. 21, Wellclose Square. That same year Gerog became naturalized, allowing him to own English land.In 1787 Wolff was appointed the Danish Consul in London, replacing Peder Anker. The Danish consulate in London was responsible for Danish-Norwegian interests throughout the southern coasts of England, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. All Danish-Norwegian ships arriving in London were required to report information concerning their cargo and journey to the consulate, placing Georg Wolff and his firm at the center of the northern timber trade and greatly raising Wolff's status in society. Upon Britain's entry into the War of the First Coalition in 1793, the Royal Navy began taking Danish ships as prize ships.

Termeer created a business model adopted by many others in the biotech industry by garnering steep prices— mainly from insurers and government payers— for therapies for rare genetic disorders known as orphan diseases that mainly affect children. Genzyme uses biological processes to manufacture drugs that are not easily copied by generic-drug makers. The drugs are also protected by orphan drug acts in various countries which provides extensive protection from competition and ensures coverage by publicly funded insurers. As CEO of Genzyme from 1981 to 2011, he developed corporate strategies for growth including optimizing institutional embeddedness nurturing vast networks of influential groups and clusters: doctors, private equity, patient-groups, insurance, healthcare umbrella organizations, state and local government, alumni. Termeer is ""connected to 311 board members in 17 different organizations across 20 different industries"" including Verastem, Inc. He has the legacy of being the ""longest-serving CEO in the biotechnology industry.He is an ""advocate for the Massachusetts biotech industry."" ""To generate revenues to fund the research, Termeer entered into a number of side ventures including a chemical supplies business, a genetic counseling.""Termeer was named as one of the top fifty leaders of thought in orphan drugs and rare diseases in a list published by Terrapin for the World Orphan Drug Congress which included ""eminent personalities that have advanced rare disease research.""""Henri was a biotech pioneer long before anyone knew what biotechs were. He founded Genzyme which is often said to have kick started today’s orphan drug biotech M&A frenzy. Henri is definitely a mover/shaker in the biotech world and in the orphan drug space. He will always be known as the guy who figured out how to build a great business by making drugs for rare diseases. An inspiration and pioneer, many of his protégés have since moved on to lead other successful companies in the rare disease and biotech space thanks to his influence."""

By the time he was 31, his tumor weighed 15 kg.Around 2007, he caught the attention of the doctors at the Fuda Cancer Hospital in Guangzhou, who decided to try removing the tumor.

(4.5 kg) of tissue from the same side.A third operation was scheduled for late 2008, which would have removed the tumor on the left side of his face.In the BodyShock series, Huang was the subject of a 2008 documentary episode entitled I Am the Elephant ManIn 2013, another 3 lbs were removed from his face."

Wynne (born March 19 1943 in Brooklyn)  is an American physicist at IBM Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY.Wynne pioneered the use of excimer lasers for medical applications, most notably LASIK. He received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation on Feb 2, 2013 from U.S. President Obama, together with Rangaswamy Srinivasan and (posthumously) Samuel Blum for their contributions to laser eye surgery.Wynne studied at Harvard University receiving the bachelor's degree in 1964, master's degree in 1965 and his doctorate in applied physics in 1969. He then joined IBM Research, first at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory and then at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.His research has been in nonlinear optics of semiconductors and insulators, nonlinear spectroscopy of atomic and molecular vapors physics of Clusters, using the laser to etch and in medicine (e.g., fluorescence studies of tissue).In 1981, with Rangaswamy Srinivasan and Samuel E. Blum at IBM, he pioneered the use of excimer lasers in surgery. Based on an early experiment in which an excimer laser was able to make clean cuts in dead cartilage from a Thanksgiving turkey, without thermal damage, they recognized the potential for surgery. Srinivasan later developed on this basis, with Bodil Braren and Stephen Trokel, applications to eye surgery in the form of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and LASIK.  Wynne himself worked on applications in dermatology with doctors at New York University Medical School (1985).He was Manager for nonlinear spectroscopy, laser physics and chemistry and biology and molecular physics at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Center and the Zurich research center.Wynne was a visiting scholar at the University of Chicago, the University of Rochester, the Dartmouth College and Johns Hopkins University.He is now responsible for education outreach at IBM Thomas J. Watson Center. He also conducts research on the development of  intelligent  scalpels with excimer lasers for the removal of necrotic skin from burn injuries.In 2004 he received the R. W. Wood Prize, 2010. Rank Prize in Optoelectronics and 2013, the Russ Prize of the National Academy of Engineering. He received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for 2011. 1990 he was awarded the IBM Outstanding Innovation Award. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), the IEEE and Optical Society of America (OSA). He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002.

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Janet_E._Mertz","Janet E. Mertz (born 1949) is an American biochemist, molecular biologist, and cancer researcher.  She is currently the Elizabeth McCoy Professor of Oncology in the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin – Madison.  Mertz is best known for disproving Lawrence Summers’ 2005 suggestion that women lack the intrinsic aptitude to excel in mathematics at the highest level  and for discovering an easy method for joining together DNAs from different species .  This latter finding initiated the era of genetic engineering whose ramifications form the basis of modern genetics and the biotechnology industry.After completing bachelor degrees in biology and electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mertz attended graduate school at Stanford University from 1970-1975, earning a Ph.D. in Biochemistry. While taking a course held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in summer 1971, she mentioned her plan to grow mutants of the oncovirus, SV40, by molecular cloning of them in the human gut bacterium, E. coli.  This event led, initially, to a voluntary moratorium on cloning of viral oncogenes and, later on, the cloning of any DNA that might contain potentially biohazardous materials until theoretical safety concerns could be addressed and guidelines for their safe use could be developed and implementedIn the interim, in collaboration with Ronald W. Davis, Mertz discovered that DNA ends generated by cutting with the EcoRI restriction enzyme are “sticky”, permitting any two such DNAs to be readily “recombined”. Using this discovery, in June 1972 she easily created the first recombinant DNA that could have been cloned in bacteria . Her success with this project contributed to her thesis adviser, Paul Berg, receiving the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  However, Mertz did not proceed with this cloning because of the moratorium in place at that time, leaving it for Herbert Boyer, Stanley N. Cohen and their colleagues to prove in 1973 that recombinant DNAs made by this method can actually self-replicate in bacteria.  Thus, most of Mertz’s Ph.D. thesis centered, instead, around developing other ways to create, select, and grow mutants of SV40 for studying this virus’ functions and so it could be used as the first eukaryotic cloning vector.  The US Patent 4,237,224, Process for Producing Biologically Functional Molecular Chimeras”, which generated over $250 million in licensing and royalty income, listed only Boyer and Cohen as co-inventors .  Some have questioned whether these patents were valid given the earlier publications by Peter Lobban and A. Dale Kaiser  and the Berg laboratory  that were already in the public domain at the time this application was filed in November 1974"

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Hallebone","Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Hallebone (born 3 August 1929) is a former Australian cricketer who played at first-class level for Victoria between 1952 and 1955. He is best known for his accomplishment of scoring a double century on his first-class debut, which made him the third Australian to accomplish that feat, and as of 2015 the last to do so.Hallebone was born in East Coburg, a suburb of Melbourne, to Dorothy Jessie (née Renshaw) and Edward Stephen Hallebone. He went to school in Geelong, attending Geelong High School before going on to Geelong College, where he played both cricket and football, for his final two years. During the 1948–49 season, Hallebone began playing for the South Melbourne Cricket Club in the Victorian grade cricket competition. He finished the season having played in all 15 matches, although his 17 innings yielded only two half-centuries. In his second season, however, he led South Melbourne's batting aggregates, with 459 runs from 13 matches.Against Northcote in December 1951, during the 1951–52 season, Hallebone scored 179 runs out of a team total of 359. Less than two weeks after that innings, he was named twelfth man for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland. Later in the season, in February 1952, Hallebone was named in the state team for a non-Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania, which had first-class status. Aged 22 on debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he came in sixth in Victoria's first innings, and scored 202 runs before being dismissed by Noel Diprose. His innings included a 343-run fifth-wicket partnership with Richard Maddocks (who scored 271), which remains a Victorian first-class record as of August 2015. Hallebone became the second Victorian (after Sam Loxton), the third Australian (after Norman Callaway and Loxton), and the seventh player overall to score a double century on his first-class debut. He is the most recent Australian to have achieved the feat, which has only been performed seven more times since his innings.Despite their performances, both Hallebone and Maddocks were dropped from the team for Victoria's next Sheffield Shield match, against South Australia, owing to the return of several Victorian players from the Australian national team. Hallebone first played Shield cricket during the 1952–53 season, and by the 1953–54 season had established himself as one of Victoria's top-order batsmen, playing in every match. In that season, he scored 563 runs to place third for runs scored for his team, behind Ray Harvey and Colin McDonald. Hallebone's total included two centuries, both against Queensland – 108 runs in the home fixture at the MCG, and then 143 not out in the away fixture at The Gabba. The second innings, which included six sixes from the bowling of Mick Raymer, was well received by the Brisbane Courier-Mail, which described him as ""a mixture of Ken Mackay at his dourest and Richie Benaud at his brightest"". Late in the season, Hallebone also scored 99 against the touring New Zealand team that was on its way back from a Test series in South Africa.During the 1954–55 Shield season, which was reduced to a single round-robin format, with only four matches per team, Hallebone scored only 44 runs from Victoria's first three games, and was dropped for the final match. The next season, he played only twice, against Queensland and New South Wales, in what were the last matches of his first-class career. In December 1955, he left Australia for eight months to gain business experience in England and the United States. Hallebone, who was 26 at the time of his last state game, finished his career with a first-class batting average of 41.10, having scored 1,192 runs. He continued playing grade cricket for South Melbourne until the 1965–66 season, retiring at the age of 36."

He is regarded as ""a founding father of North Korean poetry"" whose distinct Soviet-influenced style of lyrical epic poetry became an important feature of North Korean literature. He was nicknamed ""Korea's Mayakovsky"" after the writer whose works had had an influence on him and which implied his breaking from literature of the old society and his commitment to communist values. After a remark made by Kim Jong-il on his 2001 visit to Russia, North Korean media has referred to Jo as the ""Pushkin of Korea"".Jo was dispatched by the Soviet authorities to liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had much experience of Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Jo would shape the cultural institutions of the new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Jo did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become the driving force of North Korean literature and arts.Jo offered some of the earliest contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paketu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Jo include ""Whistle"", a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both North and South Korea. During the Korean War, Jo wrote wartime propaganda poems. He died during the war in a United Nations force bombing raid. He and his works are still renowned in North Korean society."

From 1186 to 1189 he was the chancellor of Henry of Hohenstaufen, King of the Romans and imperial regent while his father, the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, was on crusade;  on  Henry's initiative, John was elected as archbishop of Trier in September 1189, replacing the see’s rival archbishops, the just-deceased Fulmar of Karden and the imperial anti-archbishop Rudolf of Wied, and was formally confirmed the following year by Pope Clement III.Among his first duties as archbishop were the reorganization and strengthening of the archdiocese (in both its ecclesiastical and its secular aspects), the fortification of the city of Trier, and the acquisition of a number of castles. John established the ""Liber annalium jurium,"" a comprehensive reckoning of all the properties and privileges of the archbishopric (similar to the English Domesday Book of William the Conqueror) and one of the most important historical sources for the city and territory of Trier.In early 1196 Archbishop John had the legendary ""Holy Robe"" of Christ displayed again in the west choir of the Cathedral of Trier.  This particular occasion not only allowed him to consecrate the new east choir of the restored cathedral on May 1 of that year, but also for him to translate the re-discovered Tunica of Christ – the ""seamless garment"" – to a newly built and consecrated shrine, paving the way for future public celebrations of the famous relic. Also at his behest the restoration of the Church of Our Lady at Andernach and the Basilica of St. Castor at Koblenz were undertaken.In 1198, the archbishop attained the release of both the archbishopric and the city of Trier from the suzerainty of the Count Palatine of the Rhine.  In 1203, having been threatened with excommunication by Pope Innocent III due to his fluctuating support of the rival imperial candidates, the Staufen Philip, Duke of Swabia and the papal favorite, the Welfic Otto of Brunswick, John undertook a journey to Rome and was formally rehabilitated. He made a second journey to Rome in 1209, accompanying Otto, then King of the Romans, to his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor.John I died in Trier in 1212 and was buried in Himmerod Abbey in the Eifel."
